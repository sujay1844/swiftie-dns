Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""
[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how it felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on and make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)
Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it nowEmbed"

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
You might also like[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""

Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains

""Speak now or forever hold your peace""

Horrified looks from everyone in the room

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feelin' like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them

I just wanna feel okay again

Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

You got nothing to regret

Forcing laughter, faking smiles

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss

I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashеd through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through

Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war

We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right

Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine

The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones

So scarlet, it was maroon

We were shaking, blind and hazy

And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones

Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one

Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I

Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Could've followed my fears all the way down

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here

'Cause there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
And I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to

'Cause I honestly believed in you

Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know

I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well

She's going off about something that you said

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out

I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

Before the fight, before I locked you out

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours

And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking

Full of cages, full of fences

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you

And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me

And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign

[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Like some kind of congressman?

Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay
Carolina knows why for years I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here
And she's in my dreams
[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Verse 2]
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indeliblе scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life shе fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes, down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here (Mhm)
They never saw me

[Verse 3]
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast, and I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me, the sand, and the sea

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it all too well (Just between us)
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
People love an ingénue (Ah)

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran & Both]
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all

I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture

Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]

Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you

Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities

You said it in a simple way
4 a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out

Chose the rose garden over Madison Square

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do

Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""

You said it in a simple way
4 a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same
[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""

I remember the drive home, when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear

Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute

I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun

And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 2]
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
You might also like[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you

[Bridge]
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""Do you know how much I miss you?""

[Breakdown]
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""
[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

It was all over the place

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure

I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you

What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Disappointments, close your eyes

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for

On the dresser, vacant just like me

Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen
[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
And I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on

When the porch lights were shining bright

I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Is this in my head? I don't know what to think

I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

From the far side of the gym

And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party

Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?

But I know I miss you

Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight

Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no

Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me"

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined

Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me

Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see

And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch

My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave

It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

Fifteen

And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'

And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?

Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

Standing in front of you saying, ""I'm sorry for that night""

Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

""Run as fast as you can""

You told me you loved me

Fresh on the pavement

The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""

If you have children some day

Please tell 'em my name

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

And right there where we stood

But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)

And I would've been so happy

Standing there in my party dress

Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight

Without knowing anything at all

I was thinking that you could be trusted

Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?

Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't

But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey

3310416,Reputation [Prologue],350247,Reputation,/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/Reputation,"Here's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

There will be no further explanation

There will be just reputation."
3312790,Why She Disappeared [Poem],350247,Reputation,/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/Reputation,"When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""
When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes

When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.

When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""
And even louder:
""without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.""
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive."
3312706,If Youre Anything Like Me [Poem],350247,Reputation,/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/Reputation,"If you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.
If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.

If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.
If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay."

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending

Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Haunted by the look in my eyes

Should've kept every grocery store receipt

Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

You're alive, you're alive in my head

Put me in a bad light

Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters

Staring out an open window
Catching my death

Is there a line that I could just go cross?

I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)

Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope

Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything

Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

Always remember to do what you want and what you feel is right because in the end your happiness is what matters, not anyone else’s opinion

OT:
You’re going to meet some really amazing people who are going to love you, respect you, cherish you, and value you. But you’re also going to meet some people who are not going to do so, who are going to hurt you, who are going to judge you, who are going to manipulate you, and abuse you. But that should not dictate who you are, nor should that dictate what you are able to do with your life, and with the time that you havе here

KO:
To embracе the unknown. To go for things that you want. It may seem incredibly scary at the moment but I would much rather do something and find that I hate it than wonder what if I had done the thing that scared me. Life is wildly different than one can ever imagine if you just really are not afraid to try

CS:
Living freely and authentically will bring the most amazing people into your life that will love you and adore you for who you truly are, and that love will far surpass anything you ever experienced when you were constantly battling yourself and trying to be someone that you’re not

MA:
The world is gonna throw a lot of things your way that you can’t change, and a lot of them are gonna suck, and they’re going to be really hard and confusing. But you will grow, and you will learn, and you’ll become stronger for it. So I know it’s hard but just stay the course and in the meantime, relish in the little things

MP:
You are going to meet people who are going to be so worth your time, and your effort, and your love, and they’re going to be happy to have you in their lives. You are going to learn so much from them. You’re going to learn to love yourself. You’ll know what it’s like to lose people. You’ll know what it’s like to let go of people. It’s going to hurt but from it you’re going to grow

UG:
You are worthy of love. Don’t chase people who aren’t willing to give you their love or gonna make you climb mountains to be respected or given attention. They’re not worth your energy, and if someone doesn’t love you the way you need, don’t be afraid to let go because somebody else will

RS:
So I think with life you have to believe you’ve got a whole lot of fight in you even if it feels like you don’t have so much. You can face the world like Taylor Swift singing to a concert full of fans about her smelly men breaking her heart into bits. You have to face the world like that: bravely and always sincerely. Be you or I don’t know, be Taylor Swift. Either ways, don’t change yourself to fit the world

NP:
Have no regrets. Take every opportunity you get, every situation, every fun activity, every chance to discuss or say something, take it. See what happens. You will never know what the outcome is if you don’t take the opportunity
You might also likeGB:
To not be afraid to change, and that the people that are around you will not always be the people around you so don’t make yourself so obsessed with trying to meet the best people you can find for the rest of your life

ML:
I think it is important to live fiercely everyday, and take every day as an opportunity to make yourself better, to learn new things, to love new people, forgive people, to improve on yourself, and to forgive yourself

CG:
Becoming an adult isn’t all that different than your journey as a child, you just have to take it one step at a time. You may fall down sometimes. You may need some help standing back up, but you will get where you’re supposed to be in the end. So take your time, and enjoy the journeyEmbed"

I’m immune to the boos, I’ma prove to you losers (Huh?)
It’s all in timing, nigga (Get 'em!)
See, I dreamed my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga (Get 'em!)
Now Jay my big brother and Bey my lil' sister (Get 'em!)
And excuse me, but, you can’t see my lil' sister (Hands in the air!)
Number one sound across the board, hey (Oh!)
Number one now and forevermore, hey (Oh!)
Number one rule is, ""Niggas, don’t hate""
Maybe I’ll drop the album... nah, y’all gotta wait (Oh!)
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I’m the one that got away (Woo!)
I think about 'em Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway (Ayy!)
And keep my bulletproof-hater coat on
Chill, Ye, Ye, chill! Chill, chill, chill!
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on (Yah!)
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on (Woo!)
That’s what Dre said, but this what 'Ye said (Right!)
How 'Ye doing? Who 'Ye screwin'? (Huh?)
That’s for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain’t give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction no-
-tice, ""Get yo’ ass out, bitch, vamonos"" (Oh!)
Five seconds to the song end, we getting close (Hah?)
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn’t know

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, 'Ye, chill, chill, chill
Shit's burned up already
It's over"

All this college shit has got my swag ruin
People think I sound like Eminem
And I say, “mama, you do not have to pretend to get my rap music
Took this girl to homecoming, wake and bake
Picked her ass up and then we went to the steak and shake
Conversation is my casket
So I just sat there and played with sugar packets
Got more money then Jeanne Garafalo
Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
Always rocking with the confidence
Hoes show me love, hosts show me condiments
Leave the diner, gotta steal a lotta mints
Kickin fucking cockheads in with my consonants
Cigarettes and alcohol, they yell at us for loitering
Go ahead, slip it in her drink like Freudian
Going to Dr. Kevorkian cause I can’t sleep
Keep waking up in cold sweats from this damn heat
People download your mix tape from websites
But then are like, this fucker ain’t worth the megabytes
Cracking backs in half to cats who take a crack at us
I’m so sweaty, my ass hair’s napping up
I rap what I know, and I know about sex
Cause people like to have it with a girl
Love getting mail, fills up my eagerness
Got a lotta letters today all labeled “Dear John”
But I made the best of it to celebrate my singleness
And put a bunch of amaretto inside of the beer bong
You might also likeYou can’t dance with me
You can’t dance with me
These motherfuckers couldn’t handle me
So what the fuck makes you think you could dance with me
You can’t dance with me
You can’t dance with me
These motherfuckers dance like an amputee
No wonder why they can’t dance with me

They said I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
That’s a pretty bad way to start a graduation
Ceremony, I don’t get money, I just get naked
First rapist to make it onto your favorite playlist
Kids get song ideas when I’m repping
Like R Kelly playing seven minutes in heaven
Spin the bottle, never have I ever had to be a better
Rappers then these liquored up shits, I need a pick me up
Fighting fuckers, their bongs are all that hit well
Traded in my green day for Big L, shit’s swell
I’m just happy that a pretty cool black dude
Says he flamboyant for life in his raps too
Whip my pubic hair back and forth at that ho Willow
Throw it into girls without taking off the throw pillows
I can hold a mic but not a conversation
Alone in my bedroom, chronic imagination
You can’t dance with me
You can’t dance with me
You used to not even be a fan of me
Now your asking if you can dance with me
You can’t dance with me
You can’t dance with me
Representing the bourgeoisie
But these working class bitches can’t dance with me

Im a mobster, I get your bitch mom hurt
Doing peyote at a Taylor Swift concert
Cause I’m fearless and hung like a white horse
Need to quit buying all these pre-teens five course
Meals, red lobster, get my chowder on
But they keep thinking that my songs are our songs
They’re all begging, “Brandon Write a song for me!”
But I’m pretty sure that none of you belong with me
Head inflated like economy
And I thought it was partly you and you thought it was partly me
Probably a part of me that didn’t really work right
Maybe I have gotten drunk and fucked up some of your nights
One too many times, but hey that’s college
And also what you get when dating a party-aholic
Go ahead and jump ship, dumb bitch
Fuck this, I’ll get high and watch Wallace and Grommet
Next year I picked up this girl again
Only this time she told kids we’re just friends
Hanging on the wall like a skin tag, while she’s
Grinding on some get swag jock guy who went stag
She couldn’t think of much to say
And I couldn’t think of much to ask
Hugged her at the door and said have a nice day
And she still said, Brandon we’re moving too fast
You can’t dance with me…

I’m burping up the taste of her tongue
Giving crack out at maternity wards
And I’m not gonna stop cause theirs work to be done"

Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needs

(sample)

Down to earth, leave the ego trip
Play the action hero, thats zero hits
Keep my tricks, beneath my sleeve
See a voice can open doors I need alisha's keys
Or Stevie's songs, wondrous CD roms
Till I can Channel three at once
Remote chance you'll see me on
Commercial breaks, to get my first commercial break
Shame cos your best verse ain't better than the worst I make

But then again with the pen I question
How to impress my expression?
If I don't pay you don't pay me attention
Degraded, late for detention
Berated, I wait on the bench and
Eventually I'm gonna make my start
Young blood with a body of work
But flowing in vein that'll break my heart
Sacred art or waste of time, I guess that you decide?
Killing myself to be myself, artistic suicide
Don't like what I see when I'm wide awake
So I escape that's no surprise, close my eyes
Wrote my rhymes, thinking of a life I hope is mine
You might also like(chorus)

Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needs

(sample)

Fame won't suit me, Interrupt the taylor swift
That relationship will tie you up, I sail adrift
The more ipod ports, I'm downloaded on..
The more you owe me one, the only hope - Obi Wan
I lay a hot verse, never lukewarm
Soloist or group, shown up in your true form
Snatch the mask off the empire, barefaced liars in the blast of my pen fire

(It's too real)

But then again I might be fictive
Voice in the mind, lines are addictive
Like coke, call it cola or cain
Polar flow, cold blow to the brain
Freeze, at ease I breeze on by
Like a private jet but not quite that fly
More like a paper plane
No jet fuel for the naked flame
So if I crash and burn, there'll be no ash in urn
I return, take the world by storm, striking without flashy terms
Lightning, bolt the doors
My reign, loud on the air
The last king has thrown the crown, and its now on the heir
Man on the moon, if my dream works
Smile, picture the cheese, extreme perks
Shooting stars, please me first...
Spaced out face to lace the merchandise t-shirts
Bars are mars, milky way and galaxies
Light speed beaming for your planets needsEmbed"

We met back then
It was love at first sight
We did everything we could
Just to keep things right
I fell in love
With your smile
And then you fell
For my laugh
I can see in your eyes
The things you’ve hidden
You can see in my eyes
The pain I’ve had
Through everything endured
Similarities were ensured

[Chorus]
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And I’ll take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when we’re alone
Please snuggle up close to me
Because we’re in the zone
Through the music that we share
I’ll make sure we always bear everything
Because of Taylor Swift

We only had two fights
About the non senses
We had to do everything
To keep us together
But those two fights
Wouldn’t make things right
Between us, it was bitter
You got a job in FLA
I visit you night and day
But you’re basically gone
And you made the decision
To break up with me
To set yourself free

[Chorus]
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And I’ll take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when we’re alone
Please snuggle up close to me

Through the music that we share
I’ll make sure we always bear everything
Because of Taylor Swift
[Bridge]
You left me out
In the cold
Why’d you do that?
It gets old
Now I’m standing at your door
Lookin’ for our love
I can’t find it anywhere
You left me in despair

[Chorus]
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And I’ll take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when we’re alone
Please snuggle up close to me

66822,Suppository,14637,Speak Now: World Tour Live,/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/SpeakNow_WorldTourLive,"""I promis'd you an account of what befel me, and am now resolv'd to be
As good as my word, being so met to our desires; not only to improve
Our learning, but to be merry, and put life in our discourse with
Pleasanter tales

""Fabricius Vejento has already, and that wittily, handled the juggle
Of religion, and withal discover'd with what impudence and ignorance
Priests pretend to be inspir'd: But are not our wrangling pleaders
Possest with the same frenzy? who can't it? These wounds I receiv'd in
Defence of your liberty; this eye was lost in your service; lend me a
Hand to hand me to my children, for my faltering hams are not able to
Support me

""Yet even this might pass for tolerable, did it put young beginners in
The least way to well-speaking. Whereas now, what with the inordinate
Swelling of matter, and the empty ratling of words, they only gain
This, That when they come to appear in publick, they think themselves
In another world. And therefore I look upon the young fry of
Collegiates as likely to make the most helpful blockheads, because
They neither hear nor see any thing that is in use among men: But a
Company of pirates with their chains on the shoar; tyrants issuing
Proclamations to make children kill their fathers; the answers of
Oracles in a plague-time, that three or more virgins be sacrific'd to
Appease the gods; dainty fine honey-pellets of words, and everything
So said and done, as if it were all spice and garnish
""Those that are thus bred can no more understand, than those that live
In a kitchin not stink of the grease. Give me, with your favour
Leave to say, 'twas you first lost the good grace of speaking; for
With light idle gingles of words to make sport ye have brought it to
This, That the substance of oratory is become effeminate and sunk

""Young men were not kept to this way of declaiming when Sophocles and
Euripides influenc'd the age. Nor yet had any blind alley-professor
Foil'd their inclinations, when Pindar and the Nine Lyricks durst not
Attempt Homer's Numbers: And that I may not bring my authority from
Poets, 'tis certain, neither Plato nor Demosthenes ever made it their
Practice: A stile one would value, and as I may call it, a chast
Oration, is not splatchy nor swoll'n, but rises with a natural beauty

""This windy and irregular way of babbling came lately out of Asia into
Athens; and having, like some ill planet, blasted the aspiring genius
Of their youth, at once corrupted and put a period to all true
Eloquence

""After this, who came up to the height of Thucydides? Who reach'd the
Fame of Hyperedes? Nay, there was hardly a verse of a right strain:
But all, as of the same batch, di'd with their author. Painting also
Made no better an end, after the boldness of the Egyptians ventur'd to
Bring so great an art into a narrower compass.""

At this and the like rate my self once declaim'd, when one Agamemnon
Made up to us, and looking sharply on him, whom the mob with such
Diligence observ'd, he would not suffer me to declaim longer in the
Portico, than he had sweated in the school; ""But, young man,"" said he
""because your discourse is beyond the common apprehension, and, which
Is not often seen, that you are a lover of understanding, I won't
Deceive you: The masters of these schools are not to blame, who think
It necessary to be mad with mad men: For unless they teach what their
Scholars approve, they might, as Cicero says, keep school to
Themselves: like flattering smell-feasts, who when they come to great
Men's tables study nothing more than what they think may be most
Agreeable to the company (as well knowing they shall never obtain what
They would, unless they first spread a net for their bars) so a master
Of eloquence, unless fisherman like, he bait his hook with what he
Knows the fish will bite at, may wait long enough on the rock without
Hopes of catching any thing
""Where lies the fault then? Parents ought to be sharply reprehended
Who will not have their children come on by any strict method; but in
This, as in all things, are so fond of making a noise in the world;
And in such haste to compass their wishes, that they hurry them in
Publick e'er they have digested what they have read, and put children
E'er they are well past their sucking-bottle, upon the good grace of
Speaking, than which even themselves confess, nothing is greater:
Whereas if they would suffer them to come up by degrees, that their
Studies might be temper'd with grave lectures; their affections
Fashion'd by the dictates of wisdom; that they might work themselves
Into a mastery of words; and for a long time hear, what they're
Inclined to imitate, nothing that pleas'd children, wou'd be admir'd
By them. But now boys trifle in the schools, young men are laugh'd at
In publick, and, which is worse than both, what every one foolishly
Takes up in his youth, no one will confess in his age. But that I may
Not be thought to condemn Lucilius, as written in haste, I also will
Give you my thoughts in verse

""Who ere wou'd with ambitious just desire
To mastery in so fire an art aspire
Must all extreams first diligently shun
And in a settled course of vertue run
Let him not fortune with stiff greatness climb
Nor, courtier-like, with cringes undermine:
Nor all the brother blockheads of the pot
Ever persuade him to become a sot;
Nor flatter poets to acquire the fame
Of, I protest, a pretty gentleman
But whether in the war he wou'd be great
Or, in the gentler arts that rule a state;
Or, else his amorous breast he wou'd improve
Well to receive the youthful cares of love
In his first years to poetry inclin'd
Let Homer's spring bedew his fruitful mind;
His manlier years to manlier studies brought
Philosophy must next imply his thought
Then let his boundless soul new glories fire
And to the great Demosthenes aspire
When round in throngs the list'ning people come
T'admire what sprung in Greece so slow at home
Rais'd to this height, your leisure hours engage
In something just and worthy of the stage;
Your choice of words from Cicero derive
And in your poems you design shou'd live
The joys of feasts, and terrors of a war
More pleasing those, and these more frightful are
When told by you, than in their acting were:
And thus, enrich'd with such a golden store
You're truly fit to be an orator.""
While I was wholly taken up with Agamemnon, I did not observe how
Ascyltos had given me the slip, and as I continu'd my diligence, a
Great crowd of scholars fill'd the portico, to hear, (as it appear'd
Afterwards) an extemporary declamation, of I know not whom, that was
Discanting on what Agamemnon had said; while therefore they ridicul'd
His advice, and condemn'd the order of the whole, I took an
Opportunity of getting from them, and ran in quest of Ascyltos: But
The hurry I was in, with my ignorance where our inn lay, so distracted
Me, that what way soever I went, I return'd by the same, till tir'd in
The pursuit, and all in a sweat, I met an old herb-woman: And, ""I
Beseech ye, mother,"" quoth I, ""do you know whereabouts I dwell?""
Pleas'd with the simplicity of such a home-bred jest, ""Why should I
Not?"" answer'd she; and getting on her feet went on before me: I
Thought her no less than a witch: but, having led me into a bye lane
She threw off her pyebal'd patch't-mantle, and ""here,"" quoth she, ""you
Can't want a lodging.""

While I was denying I knew the house, I observ'd a company of beaux
Reading the bills o'er the cells, on which was inscrib'd the name of
The whore and her price; and others of the same function naked
Scuttling it here and there, as if they would not, yet would be seen:
When too late I found my self in a bawdy-house, cursing the jade that
Had trapan'd me thither, I cover'd my head and was just making off
Through the midst of them, when in the very entry Ascyltos met me, but
As tir'd as my self, and in a manner dead; you'd have sworn the same
Old woman brought him. I could not forbear laughing, but having
Saluted each other, I ask'd what business he had in so scandalous a
Place? He wip'd his face, and ""if you knew,"" said he, ""what has
Happened to me--"" ""As what?"" quoth I

He faintly reply'd ""When I had rov'd the whole city without finding
Where I had left the inn, the master of this house came up to me, and
Kindly profer'd to be my guide; so through many a cross lane and blind
Turning, having brought me to this house, he drew his weapon and prest
For a closer ingagement. In this affliction the whore of the cell
Also demanded garnish-money; and he laid such hands on me, that had I
Not been too strong for him, I had gone by the worst of it.""

While Ascyltos was telling his tale, in come the same fellow, with a
Woman, none of the least agreeable, and looking upon Ascyltos
Entreated him to walk in and fear nothing, for if he would not be
Passive he might be active: the woman on the other hand press'd me to
Go in with her. We follow'd therefore, and being led among those
Bills, we saw many of both sexes at work in the cells, so much every
Of them seem'd to have taken a provocative

Nor were we sooner discover'd than they wou'd have been at us with the
Like impudence, and in a trice one of them, his coat tuck'd under his
Girdle, laid hold on Ascyltos, and threw him athwart a couch: I
Presently ran to help the undermost, and putting our strengths
Together, we made nothing of the troublesome fool. Ascyltos went off
And flying, left me expos'd to the fury; but, thanks to my strength, I
Got off without hurt

I had almost traverst the city round, when through the dusk I saw Gito
On the beggars-bench of our inn; I made up to him, and going in, ask'd
Him, what Ascyltos had got us for dinner? the boy sitting down on the
Bed, began to wipe the tears that stood in his eyes; I was much
Concern'd at it, and ask'd him the occasion; he was slow in his
Answer, and seem'd unwilling; but mixing threats with my intreaties;
""'Twas that brother or comrogue of yours,"" said he, ""that coming ere
While into our lodging, wou'd have been at me, and put hard for it
When I cry'd out, he drew his sword, and 'if thou art a Lucreece,'
Said he, 'thou hast met a Tarquin.'""

I heard him, and shaking my fist at Ascyltos; ""What saist thou,"" said
I, ""thou catamite, whose very breath is tainted?""

He dissembled at first a great trembling, but presently throwing my
Arms aside, in a higher voice cry'd out: ""Must you be prating, thou
Ribaldrous cut-throat whom, condemn'd for murdring thine host, nothing
But the fall of the stage could have sav'd? You make a noise, thou
Night-pad, who when at thy best hadst never to do with any woman but a
Bawd? On what account, think ye, was I the same to you in the aviary
That the boy here, now is!""

""And who but you,"" interrupted I, ""gave me that slip in the portico?""
""Why what, my Man of Gotham,"" continu'd he, ""must I have done, when I
Was dying for hunger? Hear sentence forsooth, that is, the ratling of
Broken glasses, and the expounding of dreams? So help me Hercules, as
Thou art the greater rogue of the two, who to get a meals meat wert
Not asham'd to commend an insipid rhimer."" When at last, having
Turn'd the humour from scolding to laughing, we began to talk soberly

But the late injury still sticking in my stomach, ""Ascyltos,"" said I
""I find we shall never agree together, therefore let's divide the
Common stock, and each of us set up for himself: Thou'rt a piece of a
Scholar, and I'll be no hindrance to thee, but think of some other
Way; for otherwise we shall run into a thousand mischiefs, and become
Town-talk.""

Ascyltos was not against it; and ""Since we have promis'd,"" said he
""as scholars, to sup together, let's husband the night too: and
To-morrow I'll get me a new lodging, and some comrade or other.""

""'Tis irksome,"" said I, ""to defer what we like"" (the itch of the flesh
Occasion'd this hasty parting, tho' I had been a long time willing to
Shake off so troublesome an observer of my actions, that I might renew
My old intrigue with my Gito)

Ascyltos taking it as an affront, without answering, went off in a
Heat: I was too well acquainted with his subtle nature, and the
Violence of his love, not to fear the effects of so suddain a breach
And therefore made after him, both to observe his designs and prevent
Them; but losing sight of him, was a long time in pursuit to no
Purpose

When I had search'd the whole town, I return'd to my lodging, where
The ceremony of kisses ended, I got my boy to a closer hug, and
Enjoying my wishes, thought myself happy even to envy: Nor had I done
When Ascyltos stole to the door, and springing the bolt, found us at
Leap-frog; upon which, clapping his hands, he fell a laughing, and
Turning me out of the saddle; ""What,"" said he, ""most reverend
Gentleman, what were you doing, my brother sterling?"" Not content
With words only, but untying the thong that bound his wallet, he gave
Me a warning, and with other reproaches, ""As you like this, so be for
Parting again.""

The unexpectedness of the thing made me take no notice of it, but
Politickly turn it off with a laugh; for otherwise I must have been at
Loggar-heads with my rival: Whereas sweetening him with a counterfeit
Mirth, I brought him also to laugh for company: ""And you, Encolpius,""
Began he, ""are so wrapt in pleasures, you little consider how short
Our money grows, and what we have left will turn to no account:
There's nothing to be got in town this summertime, we shall have
Better luck in the country; let's visit our friends.""

Necessity made me approve his advice, as well as conceal the smart of
His lash; so loading Gito with our baggage, we left the city, and went
To the house of one Lycurgus, a Roman knight; who, because Ascyltos
Had formerly been his pathick, entertain'd us handsomly; and the
Company, we met there, made our diversions the pleasanter: For, first
There was TryphÅ“na, a very beautiful woman, that had come with one
Lycas, the owner of a ship, and of a small seat, that lay next the
Sea

The delight we receiv'd in this place was more than can be exprest
Tho' Lycurgus's table was thrifty enough: The first thing was every
One to chuse his play-mate: The fair TryphÅ“na pleas'd me, and
Readily inclin'd to me; but I had scarce given her the courtesie of
The house, when Lycas storming to have his old amour slockt from him
Accus'd me at first of under-dealing; but soon from a rival addressing
Himself as a lover, he pleasantly told me, I must repair his damages
And plyed me hotly: But TryphÅ“na having my heart, I could not lend
Him an ear. The refusal set him the sharper; he follow'd me
Where-ever I went, and getting into my chamber at night, when entreaty
Did no good, he fell to downright violence; but I rais'd such an
Outcry that I wak'd the whole house, and, by the help of Lycurgus, got
Rid of him for that bout

At length perceiving Lycurgus's house was not for his purpose, he
Would have persuaded me to his own; but I rejecting the proffer, he
Made use of TryphÅ“na's authority; and she the rather persuaded me
To yield to him, because she was in hopes of living more at liberty
There. I follow'd therefore whither my love led me; but Lycurgus
Having renew'd his old concern with Ascyltos, wou'd not suffer him to
Depart: At last we agreed, that he shou'd stay with Lycurgus, and we
Go with Lycas: Over and beside which, it was concluded, that every of
Us, as opportunity offer'd, should pilfer what he could for the common
Stock

Lycas was overjoy'd at my consent, and so hasten'd our departure
That, taking leave of our friends, we arriv'd at his house the same
Day. But in our passage he so order'd the matter that he sate next
Me, and TryphÅ“na next Gito, which he purposely contriv'd to show
The notorious lightness of that woman; nor was he mistaken in her, for
She presently grew hot upon the boy: I was quickly jealous, and Lycas
So exactly remark'd it to me, that he soon confirm'd my suspicion of
Her. On this I began to be easier to him, which made him all joy, as
Being assur'd the unworthiness of my new mistress wou'd beget my
Contempt of her, and resenting her slight, I shou'd receive him with
The better will

So stood the matter while we were at Lycas's: TryphÅ“na was
Desperately in love with Gito; Gito again as wholly devoted to her; I
Car'd least for the sight of either of them; and Lycas studying to
Please me, found me every day some new diversion: In all which also
His wife Doris, a fine woman, strove to exceed him, and that so gayly
That she presently thrust TryphÅ“na from my heart: I gave her the
Wink, and she return'd her consent by as wanton a twinckle; so that
This dumb rhetorick going before the tongue, secretly convey'd each
Others mind

I knew Lycas was jealous, which kept me tongue-ty'd so long, and the
Love he bore his wife made him discover to her, his inclination to me:
But the first opportunity we had of talking together, she related to
Me what she had learn'd from him; and I frankly confess'd it, but
Withal told her how absolutely averse I had ever been to't: ""Well
Then,"" quoth the discreet woman, ""we must try our wits, according to
His own opinion, the permission was one's, and the possession
Another's.""

By this time Gito had been worn off his legs, and was gathering new
Strength, when TryphÅ“na came back to me, but disappointed of her
Expectations, her love turn'd to a downright fury; and, all on fire
With following me to no purpose, got into my intrigue both with Lycas
And his wife: She made no account of his gamesomeness with me, as well
Knowing it wou'd hinder no grist to her mill: But for Doris, she never
Left till she had found out our private amours, and gave a hint of it
To Lycas; whose jealousie having got the upper hand of his love, ran
All to revenge; but Doris, advertis'd by TryphÅ“na's woman, to
Divert the storm, forbore any such meetings

As soon as I perceiv'd it, having curs'd the treachery of TryphÅ“na
And the ingratitude of Lycas, I began to make off, and fortune
Favour'd me: For a ship consecrated to the Goddess Isis, laden with
Rich spoils, had the day before run upon the rocks

Gito and I laid our heads together, and he was as willing as my self
To be gone; for TryphÅ“na having drawn him dry, began now not to be
So fond of him. Early the next morning therefore we march'd to
Sea-ward, where with the less difficulty we got on board the ship
Because we were no strangers to Lycas's servants then in wait upon
Her: They still honouring us with their company, it was not a time to
Filch any thing; but, leaving Gito with them, I took an opportunity of
Getting into the stern, where the image of Isis stood, and strip'd her
Of a rich mantle, and silver taber, lifting other good booty out of
The master's cabin, I stole down by a rope, unseen by any but Gito;
Who also gave them the slip and sculk'd after me

As soon as I saw him I shew'd him the purchase, and both of us
Resolv'd to make what haste we could to Ascyltos, but Lycurgus's house
Was not to be reach'd the same day: When we came to Ascyltos we shew'd
Him the prize, and told him in short the manner of getting it, and how
We were made a meer may-game of love: He advis'd us to prepossess
Lycurgus with our case, and make him our friend ere the others could
See him; and withal boldly assert it, that the trick Lycas would have
Served them, was the only cause why they stole away so hastily; which
When Lycurgus came to understand, he swore he would at all times
Protect us against our enemies

Our fight was unknown till TryphÅ“na and Doris were got out of bed;
For we daily attended their levy, and waited on them while they were
Dressing; but, when contrary to custom they found us missing, Lycas
Tent after us, and especially to the sea-side, for he had heard we
Made that way, but not a word of the pillage, for the ship lay
Somewhat to sea-ward, and the master had not yet return'd on board

But at last it being taken for granted we had run away, and Lycas
Becoming uneasie for want of us, fell desperately foul on his wife
Whom he suppos'd to be the cause of our departure: I'll take no notice
Of what words and blows past between them; I know not every
Particular: I'll only say, TryphÅ“na, the mother of mischief, had
Put Lycas in the head, that it might so be, we had taken sanctuary at
Lycurgus's, where she persuaded him to go in quest of the runnagates
And promis'd to bear him company, that she might confound our
Impudence with just reproaches

The next day they accordingly set forward, and came to his house; but
We were out of the way: For Lycurgus was gone to a festival in honour
Of Hercules, held at a neighbouring village, and had taken us with
Him, of which when the others were inform'd, they made what haste they
Could to us, and met us in the portico of the temple. The sight of
Them very much disordered us: Lycas eagerly complained of our flight
To Lycurgus, but was received with such a bended brow, and so haughty
A look, that I grew valiant upon't, and with an open throat charg'd
Him with his beastly attempts upon me, as well at Lycurgus's as in his
Own house; and TryphÅ“na endeavouring to stop my mouth, had her
Share with him, for I set out her harlotry to the mob, who were got
About us to hear the scolding: And as a proof of what I said, I shew'd
Them poor sapless Gito, and my self also, whom that itch of the whore
Had even brought to our graves

The shout of the mob put our enemies so out of countenance that they
Went off heavily, but contriving a revenge; and therefore observing
How we had put upon Lycurgus, they went back to expect him at his
House, and set him right again. The solemnity ending later than was
Expected, we could not reach Lycurgus's that night, and therefore he
Brought us to a half-way house, but left us asleep next morning, and
Went home to despatch some business, where he found Lycas and
TryphÅ“na waiting for him, who so ordered the matter with him, that
They brought him to secure us. Lycurgus naturally barbarous and
Faithless, began to contrive which way to betray us, and sent Lycas to
Get some help, whilst he secured us in the village

Thither he came, ard at his first entry, treated us as Lycas had done:
After which wringing his hands together, he upbraided us with the lye
We had made of Lycas, and taking Ascyltos from us, lock'd us up in the
Room where we were, without so much as hearing him speak in our
Defence; but carrying him to his house, set a guard upon us, till
Himself should return

On the road Ascyltos did what he could to mollifie Lycurgus; but
Neither entreaties, nor love, nor tears doing any good on him, it came
Into our comerades head to set us at liberty, and being all on fire at
Lycurgus's restiness, refus'd to bed with him that night, and by that
Means the more easily put in execution what he had been thinking on

The family was in their dead sleep when Ascyltos took our fardels on
His shoulders, and getting through a breach in the wall, which he had
Formerly taken notice of, came to the village by break of day, and
Meeting no one to stop him, boldly enter'd it and came up to our
Chamber; which the guard that was upon us, took care to secure; but
The bar being of wood, he easily wrenched it with an iron crow, and
Waken'd us; for we snor'd in spight of fortune

Our guard had so over-watched themselves, that they were fall'n into a
Dead sleep, and we only wak'd at the crack. To be short, Ascyltos
Came in and briefly told us what he had done for our sakes: On this we
Got up; and as we were rigging our selves, it came into my head to
Kill the guard, and rifle the village; I told Ascyltos my mind. He
Liked the rifling well enough, but gave us a wish'd delivery without
Blood, for being acquainted with every corner of the house, he pick'd
The lock of an inner-room where the movables lay, and bringing us into
It, we lifted what was of most value, and got off while it was yet
Early in the morning; avoiding the common road, and not resting till
We thought our selves out of danger

Then Ascyltos having got heart again, began to amplifie the delight he
Took in having pillag'd Lycurgus; of whose miserableness he, not
Without cause, complain'd; for he neither paid him for his nights
Service, nor kept a table that had either meat, or drink on't, being
Such a sordid pinch-peny; that, notwithstanding his infinite wealth
He deny'd himself the common necessaries of life

Unhappy Tantalus, amidst the flood
Where floating apple on the surface roll'd
Ever pursu'd them with a longing eye
Yet could not thurst nor hunger satisfie
Such is the miser's fate; who midst his store
Fearing to use, is miserably poor

Ascyltos would have been for Naples the same day, had I not told him
How imprudent it was to take up there, where, forasmuch as could be
Conjectur'd, we were most likely to be sought after: ""And therefore,''
Said I, ""let's keep out of the way for the present, and, since we have
Enough to keep us from want, stroul it about till the heat be over.""
The advice was approv'd, and we set forward for a pleasant
Country-town, where we were sure to meet some of our acquaintance that
Were taking the benefit of the season: But we were scarce got half
Way, when a shower of rain emptying it self upon us like buckets
Forc'd us into the next village; where entring the inn, we saw a great
Many others that had also struck in, to avoid the storm. The throng
Kept us from being taken notice of, and gave us the opportunity of
Prying here and there, what we might filch in a crowd, when Ascyltos
Unheeded of any one, took a purse from the ground, in which he found
Several pieces of gold; we leap'd for joy at so fortunate a beginning;
But fearing, lest some or other might seek after it, we slunk out at a
Back-door, where we saw a groom saddling his horses; but, as having
Forgotten somewhat, he run into the house leaving behind him an
Embroider'd mantle, mail'd to one of the saddles: In his absence I cut
The straps and under the covert of some out-sheds we made off with it
To a neighbouring forest. Being more out of danger among the thickets
We cast about where we should hide the gold that we might not be
Either charg'd with the felony, or robb'd of it our selves: At last we
Concluded to sow it in the lining of an old patcht coat which I threw
Over my shoulders and entrusted the care of the mantle to Ascyltos, in
Design to get to the city by cross-ways: But as we were going out we
Heard somewhat on our left hand to this purpose: ""They shall not
Escape us; they came into the wood; let's separate ourselves and beat
About, that we may the better discover and take them."" This put us
Into such a fright that Ascyltos and Gito fled through briars and
Brambles to the city-ward; but I turn'd back again in such a hurry
That without perceiving it the precious coat drop'd from my shoulders:
At last being quite tir'd and not able to go any further, I laid me
Down under the shelter of a tree where I first miss'd the coat: Then
Grief restor'd my strength, and up I got again to try if I could
Recover the treasure; I ran hither and thither and every where but to
No purpose; but spent and wasted between toil and heaviness, I got
Into a thicket, where having tarried four hours, and half dead with
The horror of the place, I sought the way out; but going forward, a
Country-man came in sight of me: Then I had need of all my confidence
Nor did it fail me: I went up roundly to him, and making my moan how I
Had lost my self in the wood, desir'd him tell me the was to the city:
He pittying my figure (for I was as pale as death, and all bemir'd)
Ask'd me if I had seen any one in the wood? I answer'd, not a
Soul--on which he courteously brought me into the highway, where he
Met two of his friends, who told him, they had travers'd the wood
Thro' and thro' but had light upon nothing but a coat, which they
Shew'd him

It may easily be believed I had not the courage to challenge it, tho'
I knew well enough what the value of it was: This struck me more than
All the rest; however, bewailing my treasure, the country-man not
Heeding me, and feebleness growing upon me, I slacken'd my pace, and
Jogg'd on slower than ordinarily

It was longer e're I reach'd the city than I thought of; but coming to
The inn, I found Ascyltos half dead, and stretcht on a straw pallet
And fell on another my self, not able to utter a word: He missing the
Coat was in a great disorder, and hastily demanded of me, what was
Become of it: I on the other hand, scarce able to draw my breath
Resolv'd him by my languishing eyes, what my tongue would not give me
Leave to speak: At length recovering by little and little, I plainly
Told him the ill luck I had met with: But he thought I jested, and
Tho' the tears in my eyes might have been as full evidence to him as
An oath, he yet questioned the truth of what I said, and would not
Believe but I had a mind to cheat him. During this, Gito stood as
Troubled as my self, and the boy's sadness increased mine: But the
Fresh suit that was after us, distracted me most. I opened the whole
To Ascyltos who seem'd little concern'd at it, as having luckily got
Off for the present, and withal assur'd himself, that we were past
Danger, in that we were neither known, nor seen by any one: However
It was thought fit to pretend a sickness, that we might have the
Better pretext to keep where we were: But our monies falling shorter
Than we thought of, and necessity enforcing us, we found it high time
To sell some of our pillage

It was almost dark, when going into the brokers market, we saw
Abundance of things to be bought and sold: of no extraordinary value
'tis true; yet such whose night-walking trade, the dusk of the evening
Might easily conceal. We also had the mantle with us, and taking the
Opportunity of a blind corner, fell a shaking the skirt of it, to try
If so glittering a shew would bring us a purchaser; nor had we been
Long there, e're a certain country-man, whom I thought I had seen
Before, came up to us with a hussye that follow'd him, and began to
Consider the mantle more narrowly, as on rhe other side did Ascyltos
Our country chapman's shoulders, which presently startled him, and
Struck him dumb, nor could my self behold 'em without being concern'd
At it, for he seemed to me to be the same fellow that had found the
Coat in the wood, as in truth he was: But Ascyltos doubting whether he
Might trust his eyes or not, and that he might not do any thing
Rashly, first came nearer to him as a buyer, and taking the coat from
His shoulders, began to cheapen, and turn it more carefully. O the
Wonderful vagaries of fortune! for the country-man had not so much as
Examined a seam of it, but carelessly exposed it as beggars-booty

Ascyltos seeing the coat unript, and the person of the seller
Contemptible, took me aside from the crowd: And ""Don't you see
Brother,"" said he, ""the treasure I made such moan about is returned?
That's the coat with the gold in't, all safe and untoucht: What
Therefore do we do, or what course shall we take to get our own
Again?""

I now comforted, not so much that I had seen the booty, but had
Clear'd my self of the suspicion that lay upon me, was by no means for
Going about the bush, but down-right bringing an action against him
That if the fellow would not give up the coat to the right owner, we
Might recover it by law:

Laws bear the name, but money has the power;
The cause is bad when e'er the client's poor:
Those strickt liv'd men that seem above our world
Are oft too modest to resist our gold
So judgment, like our other wares, is sold;
And the grave knight that nods upon the laws
Wak'd by a fee, hems, and approves the cause

Ascyltos on the other side afraid of the law, ""Who,"" said he, ""knows
Us in this place, or will give any credit to what we say? I am clear
For buying it, tho' we know it to be our own, and rather recover the
Treasure with a little money, than embroil our selves in an uncertain
Suit""; but we had not above a couple of groats ready money, and that
We design'd should buy us somewhat to eat. Least therefore the coat
Should be gone in the mean time, we agreed, rather than fail, to sell
The mantle at a lower price, that the advantage we got by the one
Might make what we lost by the other more easie

As soon therefore as we had spread open the mantle, the woman that
Stood muffled by the country-man, having pryingly taken notice of some
Tokens about it, forceably laid both hands on't, and setting up her
Throat, cryed out, ""Thieves, thieves!""

We on the t'other part being disordered at it, lest yet he might seem
To do nothing, got hold of the totter'd coat, and as spitefully
Roar'd, they had robb'd us of it: But our case was in no wise like
Theirs, and the rabble that came in to the out-cry, ridicul'd, as they
Were won't, the weaker side, in that the others laid claim to so rich a
Mantle, and we to a ragged coat, scarce worth a good patch. At this
Ascyltos could hardly keep his countenance; but the noise being over
We see, said he, how every one likes his own best, give us our coat
And let them take the mantle

The country-man and the woman lik'd the exchange well enough, but a
Sort of petty-foggers, most of whose business was such night practice
Having a mind to get the mantle themselves, as importunately required
That both mantle and coat should be left in their hands, and the judge
Would hear their complaints on the morrow: For it was not the things
Alone that seem'd to be in dispute, but quite another matter to be
Enquir'd into, to wit, a strong suspicion of robbery on both sides

At last it was agreed to put both into some indifferent hand, till the
Right were determin'd; when presently one, I know not who, with a bald
Pate, and a face full of pimples, he had been formerly a kind of
Solicitor, steps out of the rout, and laying hold on the mantle, said
He'd be security it should be forth-coming the next day: when in truth
He intended nothing more, but that having gotten it into hucksters
Hands, it might be smugled among them, as believing we would never
Come to own it, for fear of being taken up for it; for our part we
Were as willing as he; and an accident befriended both of us: For the
Country-man thinking scorn of it, that we demanded to have the patcht
Coat given us, threw it at Ascyltos's head, and discharging us of
Everything but the mantle, required that to be secur'd as the only
Cause of the dispute. Having therefore recovered, as we thought, our
Treasure, we made all the haste we could to the inn, and having shut
The door upon us, made our selves merry, as well with the Judgment of
The rabble as of our detractors, who with so much circumspection had
Restor'd us our money

While we were ripping the coat and taking out the gold, we overheard
Somebody asking mine host, what kind of people those were that had
Just now come in, and being startled at it, I went down to see what
Was the matter, and understood that a city serjeant, who according to
The duty of his office, took an account of all strangers, and had seen
A couple come into the inn, whose names he had not yet registered, and
Therefore, inquired of what country they were, and what way of living
They had

But mine host gave me such a blind account of it, that I began to
Suspect we were not safe there; whereupon for fear of being taken up
We thought fit to go off for the present, and not come back again till
It was in the night, but leave the care of our supper to Gito

We had resolv'd to keep out of the broad streets, and accordingly took
Our walk thro' that quarter of the city where we were likely to meet
Least company; when in a narrow winding lane that had not passage
Thro', we saw somewhat before us, two comely matron-like women, and
Followed them at a distance to a chappel, which they entred, whence we
Heard an odd humming kind of noise, as if it came from the hollow of a
Cave: Curiosity also made us go in after them, where we saw a number
Of women, as mad as they had been sacrificing to Bacchus, and each of
Them an amulet (the ensign of Priapus) in her hand. More than that we
Could not get to see; for they no sooner perceived us, than they set
Up such a shout, that the roof of the temple shook agen, and withal
Endeavoured to lay hands on us; but we scamper'd and made what haste
We could to the inn

Nor had we sooner stuff'd our selves with the supper Gito had got for
Us, when a more than ordinary bounce at the door, put us into another
Fright; and when we, pale as death, ask'd who was there, 'twas
Answer'd, ""Open the door and you'll see:"" While we were yet talking
The bolt drop'd off, and the door flew open, on which, a woman with
Her head muffl'd came in upon us, but the same who a little before had
Stood by the country-man in the market: ""And what,"" said she, ""do you
Think to put a trick upon me? I am Quartilla's maid, whose sacred
Recess you so lately disturb'd: she is at the inn-gate and desires to
Speak with ye: not that she either taxes your inadvertency, or has a
Mind to so resent it, but rather wonders, what god brought such civil
Gentlemen into her quarters.""

We were silent as yet, and gave her the hearing, but inclin'd to
Neither part of what she had said, when in came Quartilla herself
Attended with a young girl, and sitting down by me, fell a weeping:
Nor here also did we offer a word, but stood expecting what those
Tears at command meant. At last when the showre had emptied it self
She disdainfully turn'd up her hood and clinching her fingers
Together, till the joints were ready to crack, ""What impudence,"" said
She, ""is this? or where learnt ye those shamms, and that slight of
Hand ye have so lately been beholding to? By my faith, young men, I
Am sorry for ye; for no one beheld what was unlawful for him to see
And went off unpunisht: and verily our part of the town has so many
Deities, you'll sooner find a god than a man in't: And that you may
Not think I came hither to be revenged on ye, I am more concern'd for
Your youth, than the injury ye have done me: for unawares, as I yet
Think, ye have committed an unexpiable abomination

""For my part it troubled me all night, and threw me into such a
Shaking, that I was afraid I had gotten a tertian, on which I took
Somewhat to have made me sleep; but the god appeared to me, and
Commanded me to rise and find ye out, as the likeliest way to take off
The violence of the fit. But I am not so much in pain for a remedy
As that a greater anguish strikes me to the heart, and will
Undoubtedly make an end of me, for fear in one of your youthful
Frolicks, you should disclose what you saw in Priapus's chappel, and
Utter the counsels of the gods among the people. Low as your knees, I
Therefore lift my hands t'ye, that ye neither make sport of our
Night-worship, nor dishonour the mysteries of so many years, which
'tis not every one, even among our selves, that knows.""

After this she fell a crying again, and with many a pittiful groan
Fell flat on my bed: when I at the same time, between pity and fear
Bid her take courage and assure her self of both; for that we would
Neither divulge those holy mysteries; nor if the god had prescribed
Her any other remedy fot her ague, be wanting our selves to assist
Providence, even with our own hazard

At this promise of mine, becoming more chearful, she fell a kissing me
Thick and threefold, and turning the humour of tears into laughing
She comb'd up some hair that hung over my face with her fingers, and
""I come to a truce with ye,"" said she, ""and discharge ye of the
Process I intended against you: but if ye shou'd refuse me the
Medicine I entreat of ye for the ague, I have fellows enough will be
Ready by to morrow, that shall both vindicate my reputation, and
Revenge the affront ye put upon me

""Contempt's dishono'rable, and the giver rude
T'advise the doctor, speaks the patient proud:
But l am mistress of my self so far
I can pay scorn with scorn without a war:
The wise revenge is to neglect the ill
They're not the only conquerours that kill.""

Then clapping her hands together, she turn'd off to so violent a
Laughter, that made us apprehensive of some design against us; the
Same also did the woman that came in first, and the girl that came
With her; but so mimically, that seeing no reason for so sudden a
Change, we one while star'd on one another, and otherwhile on the
Woman

At length, quoth Quartilla, ""I have commanded, that no flesh alive be
Suffered to come into this inn to day; that I may receive from you the
Medicine for the ague without interruption.""

At what time Ascyltos was a little amaz'd, and I so chill'd that I had
Not power to utter a word: But the company gave me heart not to expect
Worse, for they were but three women, and if they had any design, must
Yet be too weak to effect it against us, who if we had nothing more of
Man about us, had yet that figure to befriend us: We were all girt up
For the purpose, and I had so contriv'd the couples, that if it must
Come to a rancounter, I was to make my part good with Quartilla
Ascyltos with her woman, and Gito the girl

While I was thus casting the matter in my head, Quartilla came up to
Me, to cure me of the ague, but finding her self disappointed, flew
Off in a rage, and returning in a little while, told us, there were
Certain persons unknown, had a design upon us, and therefore commanded
To remove us into a noble palace

Here all our courage fail'd us, and nothing but certain death seem'd
To appear before us

Then I began, ""If, madam, you design to be more severe with us, be yet
So kind as to dispatch it quickly; for whate'er our offence be, it is
Not so hainous that we ought to be rack'd to death for it"": Upon which
Her woman, whose name was Psyche, spread a coverlet on the floor
Sollicitavit inguina mea mille iam mortibus frigida. Ascyltos muffled
His head in his coat, as having had a hint given him, how dangerous it
Was to take notice of what did not concern him. In the mean time
Psyche took off her garters, and with one of them bound my feet, and
With the other my hands

Thus fetter'd as I lay, ""This, madam,"" said I, ""is not the way to rid
You of your ague."" ""I grant it,"" answer'd Psyche, ""but I have a Dose
At hand will infallibly do it"" and therefore brought me a lusty bowl
Of satyricon, (a love-potion) and so merrily ran over the wonderful
Effects of it, that I had well-nigh suck'd it all off; but because
Ascyltos had slighted her courtship, she finding his back towards her
Threw the bottom of it on him

Ascyltos perceiving the chat was at an end, ""Am not I worthy,"" said
He, ""to get a sup?"" And Psyche fearing my laughter might discover
Her, clapped her hands, and told him, ""Young-man I made you an offer
Of it, but your friend here has drunk it all out.""

""Is it so,"" quoth Quartilla, smiling very agreeably, ""and has
Ercolpius gugg'd it all down?"" At last also even Gito laught for
Company, at what time the young wench flung her arms about his neck
And meeting no resistance, half smother'd him with kisses

We would have cry'd out, but there was no one near to help us; and as
I was offering to bid 'em keep the peace, Psyche fell a nipping and
Pricking me with her bodkin: on the other side also, the young wench
Half stifled Ascyltos with a dish-clout she had rubb'd in the bowl

Lastly came leaping upon us a burdash, in a rough mantle stuck with
Myrtle, girt about him; and one while almost ground our hipps to
Powder with his bobbing at us, and other while slobber'd us with his
Nasty kisses; till Quartilla, holding her staff of office in her hand
Discharg'd us of the service; but not without having first taken an
Oath of us, that so dreadful a secret should go no further than our
Selves. Then came in a company of wrestlers, and rubb'd us over with
The yolk of an egg beaten to oil: When being somewhat refresh'd, we
Put on our right gowns, and were led into the next room, that had
Three beds in it, all well appointed, and the rest of the
Entertainment as splendidly set out. The word was given, and we sate
Down, when having whet our appetites with an excellent antipast, we
Swill'd our selves with the choicest of wine; nor was it long e'er we
Fell a nodding. ""It is so,"" quoth Quartilla; ""can ye sleep when ye
Know it is the vigil to Priapus?"" at what time Ascyltos snor'd so
Soundly, that Psyche, not yet forgeting the disapointment, he gave
Her, all besooted his face, and scor'd down his shoulders with a burnt
Sticks end

Plagu'd with these mischiefs, I hardly got the least wink of sleep
Nor was the whole family, whether within doors or without, in a much
Better condition, some lay up and down at our feet, others had run
Their heads against the walls, and others lay dead asleep cross the
Threshold: The lamps also having drunk up their oil, gave a thin and
Last blaze

At this instant got in a couple of pilfering rogues to have stollen
Our wine; but while they fell a scuffling among some silver vessels
That stood upon the table, they broke the earthen pot that held the
Wine, and overthrew the table, with the plate on it, and at the same
Time also, a cup falling off the shelf on Psyche's bed, broke her head
As she lay fast asleep; on which he cry'd out, and therewith
Discovered the thieves, and wak'd some of the drunkards: The thieves
On the other hand finding themselves in a pound, threw themselves on
One of the beds, as some of the guests, and fell a snoring like the
Rest. The usher of the hall being by this time got awake, put some
More oil in the dying lamps; and the boys, having rubb'd their eyes
Return'd to their charge, when in came a woman that play'd on the
Harp, and ratling its strings, rous'd all the rest: On which the
Banquet was renew'd, and Quartilla gave the word, to go on where we
Left (that is drinking): The she harper also added not a little to our
Midnight revel

At last bolted in a shameless rascal, one of no grace either in words
Or gesture, and truly worthy of the house where he was; he also set up
His voice, 'till apishly composing himself, as if he intended somewhat
To the company, he mouth'd out these verses:

O yes! Now tumblers with your wanton tricks
Make haste, move your legs quick, make the ground drum;
With wanton arms, soft thighs, and active hips
The old, the tender, and the sweetly young

Consumptis versibus suis immundissimo me basio conspuit. Mox et super
Lectum venit atque omni vi detexit recusantem. Super inguina mea diu
Multumque frustea moluit. Profluebant per frontem sudantem acaciae
Rivi, et inter rugas malarum tantum erat cretae, ut putares detectum
Parictum nimbo laborare. Non tenui ego diutius lacrimas, sed ad
Ultiman, perductus tristitiam. ""Quaeso,"" inquam, ""domina, certe
Embasicoetan iusseras dari."" Complosit illa tenerius manus et ""O""
Inquit ""homincm acutum atque urbanitatis vernaculae fontem. Quid? tu
Non intellexeras cinaedum embasicoetan vocari?"" Deinde ut
Contubernali meo melius succederet, ""Per fidem"" inquam ""vestram
Ascyltos in hoc triclinio solus ferias aglt?"" ""Ita"" inquit Quartilla
""et Ascylto embasicoetas detur."" Ab hoc voce equum cinaedus mutavit
Transituque ad comitem meum facto clunibus eutn basiisque distrivit
Stabat inter haec Giton et risu disolvebat ilia sua. Itaque
Conspicata eum Quartilla, cuius esset puer, diligentissima
Sciscitatione quaesivit. Cum ego fratrem meum esse dixissem, ""Quare
Ergo"" inquit ""me non basiavit?"" Vocatumque ad se in osculum
Applicuit. Mox manum etiam demisit in sinum et pertrectato vasculo
Tam rudi ""Haec"" inquit ""belle cras in promulside libidinis nostrae
Militabit: hodie enim post asellum diari non sumo."" With that Psyche
Came tittering to her, and having whispered I know not what in her
Ear, Thou art in the right, quoth Quartilla, 'twas well thought on;
And since we have so fine an opportunity, why should not our Pannychis
Lose her maidenhead? And forthwith was brought in a pretty young
Girl, that seem'd not to be above seven years of age, and was the same
That first came into our room with Quartilla: All approv'd it with a
General clap, ard next desiring it, a wedding was struck up between
The boy and her. For my part I stood amaz'd, and assur'd them, that
Neither Gito, a bashful lad, was able for the drudgery, nor the girl
Of years to receive it. ""Ita,"" inquit Quartilla, ""minor eat ista quam
Ego fui, quum primum virum passa sum? Iunonem meam iratam habeam, si
Umquam me meminerim virginem fuisse. Nam et infans cum paribus
Inclinata sum, et subinde procedentibus annis maioribus me pueris
Applicui, donec ad hanc aetatem perveni. Hinc etiam puto proverbium
Natum illud, ut dicatur posse taurum tollere, qui vitulum sustulerit.""

Least therefore my comrade might run a greater hazard, I got up to the
Wedding

And now Psyche put a flame-colour veil on the girl's head; the pathick
Led before with a flamboe, and a long train of drunken women, fell a
Shouting, and drest up the bride-chamber; Quartilla, all a-gog as the
Rest, took hold of Gito and dragg'd him in with her: But truly the boy
Made no resistance; nor seem'd the girl frighted at the name of
Matrimony. When therefore they were lockt up, we sat without, before
The threshold of the chamber; and Quartilla having waggishly slit a
Chink thro' the door, as wantonly laid an ape's eye to it; nor content
With that, pluck't me also to see that childs play, and when we were
Not peeping, would turn her lips to me, and steal a kiss

The jade's fulsomeness had so tir'd me that I began to devise which
Was to get off. I told Ascyltos my mind, and he was well pleased with
It, for he was a willing to get rid of his torment, Psyche: Nor was it
Hard to be done, if Gito had not been lockt up in the chamber; for we
Were resolved to take him with us, and not leave him the mercy of a
Bawdy-house. While we were contriving how to effect it, it so
Happened that Pannychis fell out of bed, and drew Gito after her
Without any hurt, though the girl got a small knock in the fall, and
Therewith made such a cry, that Quartilla, all in a fright, ran
Headlong in, and gave us the opportunity of getting off, and taking
The boy with us; when without more ado, we flew to our inn, and
Getting to bed, past the rest of the night without fear

But going out the next day, whom should we meet but two of those
Fellows that robb'd us of the mantle, which Ascyltos perceiving, he
Briskly attack'd one of them, and having disarm'd and desperately
Wounded him, came in to my relief; who was pressing upon the other
But he behav'd himself so well, that he wounded us both, altho' but
Slightly, and got off himself without so much as a scratch

And now came the third day, that is the expectation of an
Entertainment at Trimalchio's, where every one might speak what he
Would: But having received some wounds, we thought flight might be of
More use to us than sitting still: We got to our inn therefore, as
Fast as we could, and our wounds not being great, cured them as we lay
In bed, with wine and oyl

But the rogue whom Ascyltos had hewn down, lay in the street, and we
Were in fear of being discovered, while therefore we were pensively
Considering which way to avoid the impending storm, a servant of
Agamemnon's interrupted our fears: ""And do not ye know,"" said he
""with whom we eat to-day? Trimalchio, a trim finical humorist has a
Clock in his dining-room, and one on purpose to let him know how many
Minutes of his life he had lost."" We therefore drest our selves
Carefully, and Gito willingly taking upon him the part of a servant
As he had hither to done, we bade him put our things together, and
Follow us to the bath

Being in the mean time got ready, we walk'd we knew not where, or
Rather, having a mind to divert us, struck into a tennis-court, where
We saw an old bald-pated fellow in a carnation-colour'd coat, playing
At ball with a company of boys, nor was it so much the boys, tho' it
Was worth our while, that engaged us to be lookers on as the master of
The house himself in pumps, who altogether tossed the ball, and never
Struck it after it once came to the ground, but had a servant by him
With a bag full of them, ard enough for all that play'd

We observed also some new things; for in the gallery stood two
Eunuchs, one of whom held a silver chamber-pot, the other counted the
Balls, not those they kept tossing, but such as fell to the ground
While we admir'd the humour, one Menelaus came up to us, and told us
We were come where we must set up for the night, and we had seen the
Beginning of our entertainment. As he was yet talking, Trimalchio
Snapp'd his fingers, at which sign the eunuch held the chamber-pot to
Him as he was playing; then calling for water, he dipped the tips of
His fingers in it, and dry'd them on the boys head. 'Twould be too
Long to recount every thing: We went into the hot-house, and having
Sweated a little, into the cold bath; and while Trimalchio was
Anointed from head to foot with a liquid perfume, and rubb'd clean
Again, not with linnen but with finest flannen, his three chyrurgeons
Ply'd the muscadine, but brawling over their cups; Trimalchio said it
Was his turn to drink; then wrapt in a scarlet mantle, he was laid on
A litter born by six servants, with four lacqueys in rich liveries
Running before him, and by his side a sedan, in which was carried his
Darling, a stale bleer-eyed catamite, more ill-favoured than his
Master Trimalchio; who at they went on, kept close to his ear with a
Flagellet as if he had whispered him, and made him musick all the way
Wondering, we followed, and, with Agamemnon, came to the gate, on
Which hung a tablet with this inscription:

WHAT EVER SERVANT GOES FORTH WITHOUT HIS MASTER'S COMMAND, HE SHALL
RECEIVE AN HUNDRED STRIPES

In the porch stood the porter in a green livery, girt about with a
Cherry-coloured girdle, garbling of pease in a silver charger; and
Over head hung a golden cage with a magpye in it, which gave us an All
Hail as we entred: But while I was gaping at these things, I had like
To have broken my neck backward, for on the left hand, not far from
The porter's lodge, there was a great dog in a chain painted on the
Wall, and over him written in capital letters, BEWARE THE DOG. My
Companions could not forbear laughing; bur I recollecting my spirits
Pursued my design of going to the end of the wall; it was the draught
Of a market-place where slaves were bought and sold with bills over
Them: There was also Trimalchio with a white staff in his hand, and
Minerva with a train after her entring Rome: Then having learnt how to
Cast accompt, he was made auditor; all exquisitely painted with their
Proper titles; and at the end of the gallery Mercury lifting him by
The chin, and placing him on a judgment-seat. Fortune stood by him
With a cornucopia, and the three fatal sisters winding a golden
Thread

I observed also in the same place a troop of light-horsemen, with
Their commander exercising them, as also a large armory, in one of the
Angles of which stood a shrine with the gods of the house in silver, a
Marble statue of Venus, and a large golden box, in which it was said
He kept the first shavings of his beard. Then asking the servant that
Had the charge of these things, what pictures those were in the
Middle? The Iliads and the Odysses, said he, and on the left-hand two
Spectacles of sword-playing. We could not bestow much time on it, for
By this time we were coming to the dining-room, in the entry of which
Sate his steward, taking every one's account: But what I most admir'd
Were those bundles of rods, with their axes, that were fastned to the
Sides of the door, and stood, as it were, on the brazen prow of a
Ship, on which was written

TO CAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO OF PRÃ†TORIAN DIGNITY; CINNAMUS THE
STEWARD

Under the same title also, hung a lamp of two lights from the roof of
The room, and two tablets on either side of the door; of which one, if
I well remember, had this inscription

THE THIRD AND SECOND OF THE KALENDS OF JANUARY, OUR PATRON CAIUS EATS
ABROAD

On the other was represented the course of the moon, and the seven
Stars; and what days were lucky, what unlucky, with an emboss'd studd
To distinguish the one from the other

Full of this sensuality we were now entring the room, where one of his
Boys, set there for that purpose, call'd aloud to us, ""ADVANCE
ORDERLY."" Nor is it to be doubted, but we were somewhat concern'd for
Fear of breaking the orders of the place. But while we were footing
It accordingly, a servant stript off his livery, fell at our feet, and
Besought us to save him a whipping; for he said his fault was no great
Matter, but that some cloaths of the stewards had been stolen from him
In the bath, and all of them not worth eighteen-pence

We returned therefore in good order, and finding the steward in the
Counting-house telling some gold, besought him to remit the servant's
Punishment: When putting on an haughty face, ""It is not,"" said he
""the loss of the thing troubles me, but the negligence of a careless
Rascal. He has lost me the garments I sate at table in, and which a
Client of mine presented me on my birth-day: no man can deny them to
Be right purple, tho' not double dye; yet whatever it be, I grant your
Request.""

Having receiv'd so great a favour, as we were entring the dining-room
The servant for whom we had been suitors, met us, and kissing us, who
Stood wondring what the humour meant, over and over gave us thanks for
Our civility; and in short told us we should know by and by, whom it
Was we had oblig'd: The wine which our master keeps for his own
Drinking, is the waiters kindness

At length we sate down, when a bigger and sprucer sort of boys coming
About us, some of them poured snow-water on our heads, and others
Par'd the nails of our feet, with a mighty dexterity, and that not
Silently, but singing as it were by the bye: I resolved to try if the
Whole family sang; and therefore called for drink, which one of the
Boys a readily brought me with an odd kind of tune; and the same did
Every one as you asked for any thing: You'd have taken it for a Morris
Dancers hall, not the table of a person of quality

Then came a sumptuous antepast; for we were all seated, but only
Trimalchio, for whom, after a new fashion, the chief place was
Reserv'd. Besides that, as a part of the entertainment, there was set
By us a large vessel of metheglin, with a pannier, in the one part of
Which were white olives, in the other black; two broad platters
Covered the vessel, on the brims of which were engraven Trimalchio's
Name, and the weight of the silver, with little bridges soldered
Together, and on them dormice strew'd over with honey and poppy: There
Were also piping-hot sausages on a silver gridiron, and under that
Large damsons, with the kernels of pomegranats

In this condition were we when Trimalchio himself was waddled into the
Consort; and being close bolster'd with neck-cloaths and pillows to
Keep off the air, we could not forbear laughing unawares: For his bald
Pate peep'd out of a scarlet mantle, and over the load of cloaths he
Lay under, there hung an embroidered towel, with purple tassels and
Fringes dingle dangle about it: He had also on the little finger of
His left hand, a large gilt ring, and on the outmost joint of the
Finger next it, one lesser, which I took for all gold; but at last it
Appeared to be jointed together with a kind of stars of steel. And
That we might see these were not all his bravery, he stripp'd his
Right arm, on which he wore a golden bracelet, and an ivory circle
Bound together with a glittering locket and a meddal at the end of it:
Then picking his teeth with a silver pin, ""I had not, my friends,""
Said he, ""any inclination to have come among you so soon, but fearing
My absence might make you wait too long, I deny'd myself my own
Satisfaction; however suffer me to make an end of my game"": There
Followed him a boy with an inlaid table and christal dice; and I took
Notice of one thing more pleasant than the rest; for instead of black
And white counters, his were all silver and gold pieces of money

In the mean time while he was squandering his heap at play, and we
Were yet picking a relish here and there, a cupboard was brought in
With a basket, in which was a hen carved in wood, her wings lying
Round and hollow, as sitting on brood; when presently the consort
Struck up, and two servants fell a searching the straw under her, and
Taking out some peahens eggs, distributed them among the company: At
This Trimalchio changing countenance, ""I commanded my friends,"" said
He ""the hen to be set with peahens eggs; and so help me Hercules, am
Afraid they may be half hatcht: however we'll try if they are yet
Suppable.""

The thing we received was a kind of shell of at least six pounds
Weight, made of paste, and moulded into the figure of an egg, which we
Easily broke; and for my part, I was like to have thrown away my
Share; for it seemed to me to have a chick in it; till hearing an old
Guest of the tables saying, it was some good bit or other, I searched
Further into it, and found a delicate fat wheatear in the middle of a
Well-pepper'd yolk: On this Trimalchio stopped his play for a while
And requiring the like for himself, proclaim'd, if any of us would
Have any more metheglin, he was at liberty to take it; when of a
Sudden the musick gave the sign, and the first course was scrabled
Away by a company of singers and dancers; but in the rustle it
Happening that a dish fell on the door, a boy took it up, and
Trimalchio taking notice of it, pluck'd him by the ears, and commanded
Him to throw it down again; on which the groom of the chamber came
With a broom and swept away the silver dish, with whatsoever else had
Fallen from the table

When presently came in two long-hair'd blacks, with small leather
Bottles, such as with which they strew sand on the stage, and gave us
Wine to wash our hands, but no one offered us water. We all admiring
The finicalness of the entertainment, ""Mars,"" said he, ""is a lover of
Justice, and therefore let every one have a table to himself, for
Having more elbow-room, these nasty stinking boys will be less
Troublesome to us""; and thereupon large double-eared vessels of glass
Close plaistered over, were brought up with labels about their necks
Upon which was this inscription:

OPIMIAN MUSCADINE OF AN HUNDRED YEARS OLD

While we were reading the titles, Trimalchio clapped his hands, and
""Alas, alas,"" said he, ""that wine should live longer than man! Wine
Is life, and we'll try if it has held good ever since the consulship
Of Lucius Opimius, or not. 'Tis right Opimian, and therefore make
Ready; I brought not out so good yesterday, yet there were persons of
Better quality sup'd with me.""

We drank and admired every thing, when in came a servant with a silver
Puppet, so jointed and put together that it turned every way; and
Being more than once thrown upon the table, cast it self into several
Figures; on which Trimalchio came out with his poetry:

Unhappy mortals, on how fine a thread
Our lives depend! How like this puppet man
Shall we alas! be all when we are dead!
Therefore let's live merrily while we can

The applause we gave him, was followed with a service, but respecting
The place not so considerable as might have been expected: However
The novelty of the thing drew every man's eye upon it; it was a large
Charger, with the twelve signs round it; upon every one of which the
Master cook had laid somewhat or other suitable to the sign. Upon
Aries, chick-pease, (a pulse not unlike a ram's head); upon Taurus a
Piece of beef; upon Gemini a pair of pendulums and kidneys; upon
Cancer a coronet; upon Leo an African figg; upon Virgo a well-grown
Boy; upon Libra a pair of scales, in one of which was a tart, in the
Other a custard; upon Scorpio a pilchard; upon Sagittary a grey-hound;
Upon Capricorn a lobster; upon Aquarius a goose; upon Pisces two
Mullets; and in the middle a plat of herbs, cut out like a green turf
And over them a honey-comb. During this, a lesser black carry'd about
Bread in a silver oven, and with a hideous voice, forced a bawdy song
From a buffoon that stunk like assa fÅ“tida

When Trimalchio perceived we look'd somewhat awkwardly on such course
Fare, ""Come, come,"" said he, ""fall to and eat, this is the custom of
The place.""

Nor had he sooner said it, than the fourth consort struck up; at which
The waiters fell a dancing, and took off the upper part of the
Charger, under which was a dish of cramm'd fowl, and the hinder paps
Of a sow that had farrowed but a day before, well powdered, and the
Middle a hare, stuck in with finns of fish in his side, that he look'd
Like a flying horse; and on the sides of the fish four little images
That spouted a relishing sauce on some fish that lay near them, all of
Them brought from the river Euripus

We also seconded the shout begun by the family, and fell merrily
Aboard this; and Trimalchio no less pleas'd than our selves, cryed
""Cut""; at which the musick sounding again, the carver humour'd it, and
Cut up the meat with such antick postures, you'd have thought him a
Carman fighting to an organ

Nevertheless Trimalchio in a lower note, cryed out again ""Cut:"" I
Hearing the word so often repeated, suspecting there might be some
Joke in it, was not ashamed to ask him that sate next above me, what
It meant? And he that had been often present at the like, ""You see,""
Said he, ""him that carves about, his name is cutter; and as often as
He says 'Cut,' he both calls and commands.""

The humour spoiled my stomach for eating; but turning to him that I
Might learn more, I made some pleasant discourse to him at a distance;
And at last asked him what that woman was that so often scutled up and
Down the room

""It is,"" said he, ""Trimalchio's wife, her name Fortunata, she measures
Money by the bushel; but what was she not long since? Pardon me sir
You would not have touch'd her with a pair of tongs, but now, no one
Knows how, or wherefore she's got into heaven; and is Trimalchio's all
In all: In short, if she says it is mid-night at mid-day, he'll
Believe her. He's so very wealthy, he knows not what he has; but she
Has an eye every where; and when you least think to meet her: She's
Void of all good counsel, and withal of all ill tongue; a very pye at
His bolster; whom she loves she loves; and whom she does not love, she
Does not love

""Then for Trimalchio, he has more lands than a crow can fly over;
Monies upon monies: There lies more silver in his porters lodge, than
Any one man's whole estate. And for his family, hey-day, hey-day
There is not (so help me Hercules) one tenth of them that know their
Master. In brief, there is not one of those fools about him, but he
Can turn him into a cabbage-stalk. Nor is there any occasion to buy
Any thing, he has all at his own door; wooll, marte, pepper, nay hens
Milk; do but beat about and you'll find it. In a word, time was, his
Wooll was none of the best, and therefore he bought rams at Tarentum
To mend this breed; an in like manner he did by his honey, by bringing
His bees from Athens. It is not long since but he sent to the Indies
For mushroom-seed: Nor has he so much as a mule that did not come of a
Wild ass. See you all these quilts? there is not one of them whose
Wadding is not the finest comb'd wooll of violet or scarlet colour
Dy'd in grain. O happy man! but have a care how you put a slight on
Those freed men, they are rich rogues: See you him that sits at the
Lower-end of the table, he has now the Lord knows what; and 'tis not
Long since he was not worth a groat, and carried billets and faggots
At his back; it is said, but I know nothing of it myself, but as I
Have heard, either he got in with an old hog-grubbler, or had to do
With an incubus, and found a treasure: For my part, I envy no man, (if
God gives anything it is a bit of a blow, and wills no evil to himself
) he lately set up this proclamation:

""C. POMPEIUS DIOGENES HAS SOME LODGINGS
TO LET, FOR HE HATH BOUGHT A HOUSE.""

""But what think you of him who sits in the place of a late slave? how
Well was he once? I do not upbraid him: He was once worth a hundred
Thousand sesterstias, but has not now a hair of his head that is not
Engaged; nor, so help me Hercules, is it his own fault: There is not a
Better humour'd man than himself; but those rascally freed-men have
Cheated him of all: For know, when the pot boyls, and a man's estate
Declines, farewell friends. And what trade do you think he drove? He
Had the setting forth of grave men's funerals; and with that eat like
A prince: He had his wild boars served up covered; pastry-meats
Fowl-cooks, bakers: More wine was thrown under his table than most men
Have in their cellars; a meer phantasm: And when his estate was going
And he feared his creditors might fall upon him, he made an auction
Under this title:

""JULIUS PROCULUS WILL MAKE AN AUCTION
OF SEVERAL GOODS HE HAS NO USE OF.""

The dish was by this time taken away, and the guests grown merry with
Wine, began to talk of what was done abroad, when Trimalchio broke the
Discourse; and leaning on his elbow, ""This wine,"" said he, ""is worth
Drinking, and fish must swim; but do you think I am satisfied with
That part of your supper you saw in the charger? Is Ulysses no better
Known? what then; we ought to exercise our brains as well as our
Chaps; and shew, that we are not only lovers of learning, but
Understand it: Peace rest my old tutor's bones who made me a man
Amongst men: No man can tell me any thing that is new to me; for, like
Him, I am master of the practicks

""This heaven, that's inhabited by twelve gods, turns it self into as
Many figures; and now 'tis Aries: He that's born under that sign has
Much cattle, much wooll, and to that a jolt-head, a brazen-face, and
Will be certainly a cuckold: There are many scholars, advocates, and
Horned beasts, come into the world under this sign. We praised our
Nativity-caster's pleasantness, and he went on then again: The whole
Heaven is Taurus, and wonder it e'er bore foot-ball-players
Herds-men, and such as can shift for themselves. Under Gemini are
Foaled coach-horses, oxen calved, great baubles, and such as can claw
Both sides are born. I was born my self under Cancer, and therefore
Stand on many feet, as having large possessions both by sea and land
For Cancer suits one as well as the other, and therefore I put nothing
Upon him, that I might not press my own geniture. Under Leo
Spendthrifts and bullies: under Virgo, women, runagates, and such as
Wear iron garters: under Libra, butchers, slipslop-makers, and men of
Business: under Scorpio, empoisoners and cut-throats: under Sagittary
Such as are goggle-ey'd, herb-women, and bacon-stealers: under
Capricorn, poor helpless rascals, to whom yet Nature intended horns to
Defend themselves: under Aquarius, cooks and paunch-bellies: under
Pisces, caterers and orators: And so the world goes round like a mill
And is never without its mischief; that men be either born or perish
But for that tuft of herbs in the middle, and the honey-comb upon it
I do nothing without just reason for it: Our mother the earth is in
The middle, made round like an egg, and has all good things in her
Self, like a honeycomb.""

""Most learnedly,"" we all cry'd; and lifting our hands, swore, neither
Hipparebus nor Aratus were to be compared to him, till at last other
Servants came in and spread coverlets on the beds, on which were
Painted nets, men in ambush with hunting-poles, and whatever
Appertained to hunting: Nor could we yet tell what to make of it: when
We heard a great cry without, and a pack of beagles came and ran round
The table, and after them a large trey, on which was a boar of the
First magnitude, with a cap on his head, (such as slaves at their
Making free, had set on theirs in token of liberties) on his tusks
Hung two wicker baskets, the one full of dates, the other of almonds;
And about him lay little pigs of marchpane, as if they were sucking:
They signified a sow had farrowed, and hang there as presents for the
Guests to carry away with them

To the cutting up this boar, here came not he that had carried about
The fowl as before, but a swinging fellow with a two-handed beard
Buskins on his leggs, and a short embroidered coat; who drawing his
Wood-knife, made a large hole in the boar's side, out of which flew a
Company of blackbirds: Then fowlers stood ready with their engines and
Caught them in a trice as they fluttered about the room: On which
Trimalchio ordering to every man his bird, ""See,"" said he, ""what kind
Of acorns this wild boar fed on:"" When presently the boys took off the
Baskets and distributed the dates and almonds among the guests

In the mean time, I, who had private thoughts of my own, was much
Concerned, to know why the boar was brought in with a cap upon his
Head; and therefore having run out my tittle-tattle, I told my
Interpreter what troubled me: To which he answered, ""Your boy can even
Tell ye what it means, for there's no riddle in it, but all as clear
As day. This boar stood the last of yester-nights supper, and
Dismiss'd by the guests, returns now as a free-man among us."" I curst
My dulness, and asked him no more questions, that I might not be
Thought to have never eaten before with men of sense

While we were yet talking, in came a handsome boy with a wreath of
Vine leaves and ivy about his head; declaring himself one while
Bromius, another while Lyccus, and another Euphyus (several names of
Bacchus) he carried about a server of grapes, and with a clear voice
Repeated some of his master's poetry, at which Trimalchio turning to
Him, ""Dionysius,"" said he, ""be thou Liber,"" (i.e.) free, (two other
Names of Bacchus) whereupon the boy took the cap from off the boar's
Head, and putting it on his own, Trimalchio added, ""You will not deny
Me but I have a father, Liber."" We all praised the conceit, and
Soundly kissed the boy as he went round us

From this up rose Trimalchio, and went to the close-stool; we also
Being at liberty, without a tyrant over us fell to some table-talk

When presently one calling for a bumper, ""The day,"" said he, ""is
Nothing, 'tis night e're the scene turn, and therefore nothing is
Better than to go straight from bed to board. We have had a great
Deal of frost, the bagnio has scarce heated me; but a warm drinking is
My wardrobe-keeper: For my part, I have spun this days thread; the
Wine is got into my noddle, and I am down-right--""

Selucus went on with the rest, ""And I,"" said he, ""do not bathe every
Day, for he where I use to bathe is a fuller: Cold water has teeth in
It, and my head grows every day more washy than others, but when I
Have got my dose in my guts, I bid defiance to cold: Nor could I well
Do it to day, for I was at a funeral, a jolly companion, and a good
Man was he, Crysanthus has breathed his last: 'Tis not long since we
Were together, and methinks I talk with him now. Alas, alas! we are
But blown bladders, less than flies, yet they have somewhat in them:
But we are meer bubbles. You'll say he would not be rul'd; not a drop
Of water, or crumb of bread went down his throat in five days: And yet
He's gone, or that he died of the doctor. But I am of opinion his
Time was come; for a physician is a great comfort. However, he was
Well carried out of his house upon a rich bed, and mightily lamented
He made some of his servants free; but his wife seem'd not much
Concerned for him. You'll say again he was not kind to her; but women
Are a kind of kites; whatever good is done them, 'tis the same as if
It were thrown in a well; and old love is as bad as a goal.""

At this Philaos grew troublesome, and cryed out, ""Let us remember the
Living: He had what was due to him; as he liv'd so he dy'd; and what
Has he now that any man moans the want of it? He came from nothing
And to his dying-day would have taken a farthing from a dunghil with
His teeth; therefore as he grew up, he grew like a honey-comb. He
Dy'd worth the Lord knows what, all ready money. But to the matter; I
Have eaten a dog's tongue and dare speak truth: He had a foul mouth
Was all babble; a very make-bate, not a man. His brother was a brave
Fellow, a friend to his friends, of an open hand, and kept a full
Table: He did not order his affairs so well at first as he might have
Done; but the first vintage made him up again; for he sold what wine
He would; and what kept up his chin was the expectation of a
Reversion; the credit of which brought him more than was left him; for
His brother taking a pelt at him, devised the estate to I know not
Whose bastard: He flies far that flies his relations. Besides, this
Brother of his had whisperers about him, that were back-friends to the
Other: but he shall never do right that is quick of belief, especially
In matter of business; and yet 'tis true, he'll be counted wise while
He lives, to whom the thing whatever it be is given, nor he that ought
To have had it. He was without doubt, one of fortune's sons; lead in
His hand would turn to gold, and without trouble too, where there are
Not rubbs in the way. And how many years think ye he liv'd?
Seventy-odd: but he was as hard as horn, bore his age well, and as
Black as a crow

""I knew him some years ago an oilman, and to his last a good womans
Man; but withal such a miser, that (so help me Hercules) I think he
Left not a dogg in his house. He was also a great whore-master, and a
Jack of all trades; nor do I condemn him for't, for this was the only
Secret he kept to himself and carry'd with him.""

Thus Phileros and Gammedes, as followeth: ""Ye talk of what concerns
Neither Heaven nor Earth, when in the mean time no man regards what
Makes all victuals so scarce: I could not (so help me Hercules) get a
Mouthful of bread to day: and how? The drought continues: For my
Part, I have not fill'd my belly this twelve-month: A plague on these
Clerks of the market, the baker and they juggle together; take no
Notice of me, I'll take no notice of thee; which make the poorer sort
Labour for nothing, while those greater jaw-bones make festival every
Day. Oh that we had those lyons I now find here, when I first came
Out of Asia, that had been to live: The inner part of Sicily had the
Like of them, but they so handled the goblins, even Jupiter bore them
No good-will. I remember Safinius, when I was a boy, he liv'd by the
Old arch; you'd have taken him for pepper-corn rather than a man;
Where-ever he went the earth parched under him; yet he was honest at
Bottom; one might depend on him; a friend to his friend, and whom you
Might boldly trust in the dark. But how did he behave himself on the
Bench? He toss'd every one like a ball; made no starch'd speeches
But downright, as he were, doing himself what he would persuade
Others: But in the market his noise was like a trumpet, without
Sweating or spueing. I fancy he had somewhat, I know not what, of the
Asian humour: then so ready to return a salute, and call every one by
His name, as if he had been one of us. In his time corn was as common
As loam; you might have bought more bread for half a farthing, than
Any two could eat; but now the eye of an ox will cost you twice as
Much: Alas! alas! we are every day worse and worse, and grow like a
Cows tail, downward: And why all this? We have a clerk of the market
Not worth three figgs, and values more the getting of a doit himself
Than any of our lives: 'Tis this makes him laugh in his sleeve; for he
Gets more money in a day than many an honest man's whole estate: I
Know not how he got the estate he has; but if we had any thing of men
About us, he would not hug himself as he does, but now the people are
Grown to this pass, that they are lyons at home, and foxes abroad: For
My part, I have eaten up my cloaths already, and if corn holds at the
Rate it does, I shall be forc'd to sell house and all: For what will
Become of us, if neither gods nor men pity us? Let me never enjoy my
Friends more, than I believe all this comes from Heaven; for no one
Thinks there is any such thing; no one keeps a fast, or value Jupiter
A hair, but shuts his eyes and reckons what he is worth. Time was
When matrons went bare-foot with dishevel'd hair, pure minds, and
Pray'd him to send rain, and forthwith it rained pitcher-fulls, or
Then or never, and every one was pleased: Now the gods are no better
Than mice; as they tread, their feet are wrapt in wooll; and because
Ye are not superstitious your lands yield nothing.""

""More civilly, I beseech ye,"" said Echion the hundred-constable; ""it
Is one while this way, and another while that, said the country-man
When he lost his speckled hogg: What is not to day may be to morrow;
And thus is life hurried about, so help me Hercules, a country is said
Not to be the better that it has many people in it, tho' ours at
Present labours under that difficulty, but it is no fault of hers: We
Must not be so nice, Heaven is equally distant every where; were you
In another place you'd say hoggs walked here ready dress'd: And now I
Think on't, we shall have an excellent show these holy-days, a
Fencing-prize exhibited to the people; not of slaves bought for that
Purpose, but most of them freemen. Our patron Titus has a large soul
But a very devil in his drink, and cares not a straw which side gets
The better: I think I should know him, for I belong to him; he's of a
Right breed both by father and mother, no mongril. They are well
Provided with weapons, and will fight it out to the last: the theatre
Will look like a butchers shambles, and he has where-withal to do it;
His father left him a vast sum, and let him make ducks and drakes with
It never so much, the Estate will bear it, and he always carries the
Reputation of it. He has his waggon horses, a woman-carter, and
Glyco's steward, who was taken a-bed with his mistress; what a busle's
Here between cuckolds and cuckold-makers! But this Glyco a
Money-broker, condemned his steward to fight with beasts; and what was
That but to expose himself for another? where lay the servant's crime
Who perhaps was oblig'd to do what he did: She rather deserv'd to be
Brain'd, than the bull that tossed her; but he that cannot come at the
Arse, thrashes at the pack-saddle: yet how could Glyco expect
Hermogine's daughter should make a good end? She'd have pared the
Claws of a flying kite; a snake does not bring forth a halter: Glyco
Might do what he would with his own; but it will be a brand on him as
Long as he lives; nor can any thing but Hell blot it out; however
Every man's faults are his own. I perceive now what entertainment
Mammea is like to give us; he'll be at twopence charges for me and my
Company; which if he does, he will pull Narbanus clean out of favour;
For you must know, he'll live at the full height; yet in truth what
Good has he done us? He gave us a company of gittiful sword-players
But so old and decrepid, that had you blown on them, they'd have
Fallen of themselves: I have seen many a better at a funeral pile; he
Would not be at the charge of lamps for them; you'd have taken them
For dunghil cocks fighting in the dark; one was a downright fool, and
Withal gouty; another crump-footed, and a third half dead, and
Hamstrung: There was one of them a Thracian, that made a figure, and
Kept up to the rule of fighting; but upon the whole matter, all of
Them were parted, and nothing came of this great block-headed rabble
But a downright running away: And yet, said he, I made ye a show, and
I clap my hands for company; but cast up the account, I gave more than
I received; one hand rubs another. You Agamemnon seem to tell me what
Would that trouble some fellow be at; because you that can speak, and
Do not, you are not of our form, and therefore ridicule what poor men
Say; tho', saving the repute of a scholar, we know you are but a meer
Fool. Where lies the matter then? let me persuade you to take a walk
In the country, and see our cottage, you'll find somewhat to eat; a
Chicken, some eggs, or the like: The tempestuous season had like to
Have broke us all, yet we'll get enough to fill the belly. Your
Scholar, my boy Cicero, is mightily improved, and if he lives, you'll
Have a servant of him; he is pretty forward already, and whatever
Spare time he has, never off a book: He's a witty lad, well-featur'd
Takes a thing without much study, tho' yet he be sickly: I killed
Three of his linnets the other day, and told him the weasels had eaten
Them; yet he found other things to play with, and has a pretty knack
At painting: He has a perfect aversion to Greek, but seems better
Inclined to Latin; tho' the master he has now humours him in the
Other; nor can he be kept to one thing, but is still craving more, and
Will not take pains with any. There is also another of this sort, not
Much troubled with learning, but very diligent, and teaches more than
He knows himself: He comes to our house on holidays, and whatever you
Give him he's contented; I therefore bought the boy some ruled books
Because I will have him get a smattering in accounts and the law; it
Will be his own another day: He has learning enough already, but if he
Takes back to it again, I design him for a trade, a barber, a parson
Or a lawyer, which nothing but the devil can take from him: How oft
Have I told him, Thou art (Sirrah) my first begotten, and believe thy
Father, whatever thou learnest 'tis all thy own: See there Philero the
Lawyer, if he had not been a scholar he might have starved; but now
See what trinkums he has about his neck, and dares nose Narbanus
Letters are a treasure, and a trade never dies.""

Thus, or the like, we were bandying it about when Trimalchio return'd
And having wip'd the slops from his face, wash'd his hands, and in a
Very little time, ""Pardon me, my friends,"" said he, ""I have been
Costive for several days, and my physicians were to seek about it
When a suppository of pomegranate wine, with the liquor of a pine-tree
And vinegar relieved me; and now I hope my belly may be ashamed if it
Keep no better order; for otherwise I have such a rumbling in my guts
You'd think an ox bellowed; and therefore if any of you has a mind, he
Need not blush for the matter; there's not one of us born without some
Defect or other, and I think no torment greater than wanting the
Benefit of going to stool, which is the only thing even Jupiter
Himself cannot prevent: And do you laugh, Fortunata, you that break me
So often of my sleep by nights; I never denyed any man do that in my
Room might pleasure himself, and physicians will not allow us to keep
Any thing in our bodies longer than we needs must; or if ye have any
Farther occasion, every thing is ready in the next room: Water
Chamber-pots, close-stools, or whatever else ye may need; believe me
This being hard-bound, if it get into the head, disturbs the whole
Body; I have known many a man lost by it, when they have been so
Modest to themselves as not to tell what they ailed.""

We thank'd him for his freeness, and the liberty he gave us, when yet
To suppress our laughter, we set the glasses about again; nor did we
Yet know that in the midst of such dainties we were, as they say, to
Clamber another hill; for the cloth being again taken away, upon the
Next musick were brought in three fat hogs with collars and bells
About their necks; and he that had the charge of them told us, the one
Was two years old, the other three, and the third full grown. I took
It at first to have been a company of tumblers, and that the hogs, as
The manner is, were to have shewn us some tricks in a ring, till
Trimalchio breaking my expectation, ""Which of them,"" said he, ""will ye
Have for supper? for cocks, pheasants, and the like trifles are but
Country fare, but my cooks have coppers will boil a calf whole;"" and
Therewith commanding a cook to be called for, he prevented our choice
By ordering him to kill the largest, and with a loud voice, asked him
Of what rank of servants in that house he was? to which he answering
Of the fortieth: ""Were you bought,"" said the other, ""or born in my
House?"" ""Neither,"" said the cook, ""but left you by Pansa's
Testament."" ""See then,"" said Trimalchio, ""that you dress it as it
Should be, or I'll send you to the galleys."" On which the cook
Advertised of his power, went into the kitchin to mind his charge

But Trimalchio turning to us with a pleasanter look, asked if the wine
Pleased us, ""If not,"" said he, ""I'll have it changed, and if it does
Let me see it by your drinking: I thank the gods I do not buy it, but
Have everything that may get an appetite growing on my own grounds
Without the city, which no man that I know but my self has; and yet it
Has been taken for Tarracino and Taranto. I have a project to joyn
Sicily to my lands on the continent, that when I have a mind to go
Into Africa, I may sail by my own coasts. But prithee Agamemnon tell
Me what moot-point was it you argued to day; for tho' I plead no
Causes my self, yet I have had a share of letters in my time; and that
You may not think me sick of them now, have three libraries, the one
Greek, the other two Latin; therefore as you love me tell me what was
The state of the question:"" ""The poor and the rich are enemies,"" said
Agamemnon: ""And what is poor,"" answered Trimalchio? ""Spoke like a
Gentleman,"" replyed Agamemnon. But making nothing of the matter, ""If
It be so,"" said Trimalchio, ""where lies the dispute? And if it be not
So, 'tis nothing.""

While we all humm'd this and the like stuff, ""I beseech ye,"" said he
""my dear Agamemnon, do you remember the twelve labours of Hercules, or
The story of Ulysses, how a Cyclop put his thumb out of joint with a
Mawkin? I read such things in Homer when I was a boy; nay, saw my
Self the Sybil of Curna hanging in a glass bottle: And when the boys
Asked her, 'Sybil, what wouldst thou?' She answered, 'I would die.'""

He had not yet run to the end of the rope, when an over-grown hog was
Brought to the table. We all wondered at the quickness of the thing
And swore a capon could not be dress'd in the time; and that the more
Because the hog seemed larger than was the boar, we had a little
Before: When Trimalchio looking more intent upon him, ""What, what,""
Said he, ""are not his guts taken out? No, (so help me Hercules) they
Are not! Bring hither, bring hither this rogue of a cook."" And when
He stood hanging his head before us, and said, he was so much in haste
He forgot it. ""How, forgot it,"" cry'd out Trimalchio! ""Do ye think
He has given it no reasoning of pepper and cummin? Strip him:"" When
In a trice 'twas done, and himself set between two tormentors:
However, we all interceded for him, as a fault that might now and then
Happen, and therefore beg'd his pardon; but if he ever did the like
There was no one would speak for him; tho' for my part, I think he
Deserved what he got: And so turning to Agamemnon's ear, ""This
Fellow,"" said I, ""must be a naughty knave; could any one forget to
Bowel a hog? I would not (so help me Hercules) have forgiven him if
He had served me so with a single fish."" But Trimalchio it seems, had
Somewhat else in his head; for falling a laughing, ""You,"" said he
""that have so short a memory, let's see if you can do it now."" On
Which, the cook having gotten his coat again, took up a knife, and
With a feigned trembling, ripp'd up the hog's belly long and thwart
When immediately its own weight tumbled out a heap of hogs-puddings
And sausages

After this, as it had been done of it self, the family gave a shout
And cry'd out, ""Health and prosperity to Caius!"" The cook also was
Presented with wine, a silver coronet, and a drinking goblet, on a
Broad Corinthian plate: which Agamemnon more narrowly viewing; ""I am,""
Said Trimalchio, ''the only person that has the true Corinthian
Vessels.""

I expected, that according to the rest of his haughtiness, he would
Have told us they had been brought him from Corinth: But he better:
""And perhaps,"" said he, ""you'll ask me why I am the only person that
Have them. And why, but the copper-smith from whom I buy them, is
Called Corinthus? And what is Corinthian but what is made by
Corinthus? But that ye may not take me for a man of no sence, I
Understand well enough whence the word first came. When Troy was
Taken, Hannibal, a cunning fellow, but withal mischievous, made a pile
Of all the brazen, gold and silver statues, and burnt them together
And thence came this mixt metal; which workmen afterwards carried off;
And of this mass made platters, dishes, and several other things; so
That these vessels are neither this nor that metal, but made of all of
Them. Pardon me what I say; however others may be of another mind, I
Had rather have glass ware; and if it: were not so subject to
Breaking, I'd reckon it before gold; but now it is of no esteem

""There was a copper-smith that made glass vessels of that pliant
Harness, that they were no more to be broken than gold and silver
Ones: It so happened, that having made a drinking-pot, with a wide
Mouth of that kind, but the finest glass, fit for no man, as he
Thought, less than CÃ¦sar himself; he went with his present to
CÃ¦sar, and had admittance: The kind of the gift was praised, the
Hand of the workman commended, and the design of the giver accepted
He again, that he might turn the admiration of the beholders into
Astonishment, and work himself the more into the Emperor's favour
Pray'd the glass out of the Emperor's hand; and having received it
Threw it with such a force against the paved floor, that the most
Solid and firmest metal could not but have received some hurt thereby
CÃ¦sar also was no less amazed at it, than concerned for it; but the
Other took up the pot from the ground, not broken but bulg'd a little;
As if the substance of metal had put on the likeness of a glass; and
Therewith taking a hammer out of his pocket, he hammer'd it as it had
Been a brass kettle, and beat out the bruise: And now the fellow
Thought himself in Heaven, in having, as he fansied, gotten the
Acquaintance of CÃ¦sar, and the admiration of all: But it fell out
Quite contrary: CÃ¦sar asking him if any one knew how to make this
Malleable glass but himself? And he answering, there was not, the
Emperor commanded his head to be struck off: 'For,' said he, 'if this
Art were once known, gold and silver will be of no more esteem than
Dirt.'

""And for silver, I more than ordinarily affect it: I have several
Water-pots more or less, whereon is the story how Cassandra killed her
Son's, and the dead boys are so well embossed, you'd think them real
I have also a drinking cup left me by an advocate of mine, where
DÃ¦dalus puts Niobe into the Trojan horse, as also that other of
Hermerotes; that they may stand as a testimony, there's truth in cups
And all this massy; ror will I part with what I understand of them at
Any rate.""

While he was thus talking, a cup dropt out of a boy's hand; on which
Trimalchio looking over his shoulder at him, bad him begone, and kill
Himself immediately; ""for,"" said he, ""thou art careless and mind'st
Not what thou art about."" The boy hung his lip, and besought him; but
He said, ""What! dost thou beseech me, as if I required some difficult
Matter of thee? I only bid thee obtain this of thy self, that thou be
Not careless again."" But at last he discharged him upon our entreaty
On this the boy run round the table and cry'd, ""Water without doors
And wine within."" We all took the jest, but more especially
Agamemnon, who knew on what account himself had been brought thither

Trimalchio in the mean time hearing himself commended, drank all the
Merrier, and being within an ace of quite out, ""Will none of you,""
Said he, ""invite my Fortunata to dance? Believe me, there's no one
Leads a country dance better:"" And with that, tossing his hands round
His head, fell to act a jack-pudding; the family all the while
Singing, 'youth it self, most exactly youth it self ;' and he had
Gotten into the middle of the room, but that Fortunata whispered him
And I believe told him, such gambols did not become his gravity. Nor
Was there any thing more uneven to it self; for one while he turned to
His Fortunata, and another while to his natural inclination: But what
Disturbed the pleasure of her dancing, was his notaries coming in;
Who, as they had been the acts of a common council, read aloud:

'VII. of the Calends of August born in Trimalchio's manner of cumanum
Thirty boys and forty girls, brought from the threshing-floor into the
Granary, five hundred thousand bushels of wheat. The same day broke
Out a fire in a pleasure-garden that was Pompey's, first began in one
Of his bayliffs houses.'

""How's this,"" said Trimalchio: ""When were those gardens bought for
Me?"" ""The year before,"" answered his notary, ""and therefore not yet
Brought to account.""

At this Trimalchio fell into a fume; and ""whatever lands,"" said he
""shall be bought me hereafter, if I hear nothing of it in six months
Let them never, I charge ye, be brought to any account of mine."" Then
Also were read the orders of the clerks of the markets, and the
Testaments of his woodwards, rangers, and park-keepers, by which they
Disinherited their relations, and with ample praise of him, declare
Trimalchio their heir. Next that, the names of his bayliffs; and how
One of them that made his circuits in the country, turned off his wife
For having taken her in bed with a barber; the door-keeper of his
Baths turn'd out of his place; the auditor found short in his
Accounts, and the dispute between the grooms of his chamber ended

At last came in the dancers on the rope, and a gorbelly'd blockhead
Standing out with a ladder, commanded his boy to hopp every round
Singing, and dance a jigg on the top of it, and then tumble through
Burning hoops of iron, with a glass in his mouth. Trimalchio was the
Only person that admir'd it, but withal said, he did not like it; but
There were two things he could willingly behold, and they were the
Flyers on the high rope, and quails; and that all other creatures and
Shows were meer gewgaws: ""For,"" said he, ""I bought once a sett of
Stroulers, and chose rather to make them merry-andrews than comedians;
And commanded my bag-piper to sing in Latin to them.""

While he was chattering all at this rate, a boy chanced to stumble
Upon him, on which the family gave a shriek, the same also did the
Guests; not for such a beast of a man, whose neck they could willingly
Have seen broken, but for fear the supper should break up ill, and
They be forc'd to wail the death of the boy

Whatever it were, Trimalchio gave a deep groan; and leaning upon his
Arm as if it had been hurt, the physicians ran thick about him, and
With the first, Fortunata, her hair about her ears, a bottle of wine
In her hand, still howling, miserable unfortunate woman that she was!
Undone, undone. The boy on the other hand, ran under our feet, and
Beseeched us to procure him a discharge: But I was much concern'd
Lest our interposition might make an ill end of the matter; for the
Cook that had forgotten to bowel the hog was still in my thoughts. I
Began therefore to look about the room, for fear somewhat or other
Might drop through the ceiling; while the servant that had bound up
His arm in white, not scarlet-colour flannen, was soundly beaten: Now
Was I much out, for instead of another course, came in an order of
Trimalchio's by which he gave the boy his freedom; that it might not
Be said, so honourable a person had been hurt by his slave. We all
Commended the action, but chatted among our selves with what little
Consideration the things of this world were done. ""You're in the
Right,"" said Trimalchio; ""nor ought this accident to pass without
Booking;"" and so calling for the journal, commanded it to be entered;
And with, as little thought, tumbled out these verses:

""What's least expected falls into our dish
And fortune's more indulgent than our wish:
Therefore, boy, fill the generous wine about.""

This epigram gave occasion to talk of the poets, and Marsus, the
Trachian, carry'd the bays a long while: till Trimalchio (turning to
Some wit amongst them) ""I beseech ye, master of mine,"" said he, ""tell
Me what difference take ye between Cicero the orator, and Publius the
Poet? for my part I think one was more eloquent, the other the
Honester man; for what could be said better than this.""

""Now sinking Rome grows weak with luxury
To please her appetite cram'd peacocks die:
Their gaudy plumes a modish dress supply

For her the guinnea hen and capon's drest:
The stork it self for Rome's luxurious taste
Must in a caldron build its humbl'd nest

That foreign, friendly, pious, long-leg'd thing
Grateful, that with shrill sounding notes dost sing
All winter's gone; yet ushers in the spring
Why in one ring must three rich pearls be worn
But that your wives th' exhausted seas adorn
Abroad t' increase their lust, at home their scorn?

Why is the costly emerald so desir'd
Or richer glittering carbuncle admir'd
Because they sparkle, is't with that you're fir'd?
Well, honesty's a jewel. Now none knows
A modest bride from a kept whore by 'er cloaths;
For cobweb lawns both spouse and wench expose.""

""But, now we talk after the rate of the learned, which,"" said he, ""are
The most difficult trades? I think a physician and a banker: a
Physician, because he know's a man's very heart, and when the fits of
An ague will return; tho' by the way, I hate them mortally; for by
Their good will I should have nothing but slubber-slops: And a banker
Because he'll find out a piece of brass money, tho' plated with
Silver

""There are also brute beasts, sheep and oxen, laborious in their kind:
Oxen, to whom we are beholding for the bread we eat; and sheep, for
The wooll, that makes us so fine. But O horrid! we both eat the
Mutton, and make us warm with the fleece. I take the bees for divine
Creatures; they give us honey, tho' 'tis said they stole it from
Jupiter, and that's the reason why they sting: For where-ever ye meet
Any thing that's sweet you'll ever find a sting at the end of it.""

He also excluded philosophers from business, while the memoirs of the
Family were carrying round the table, and a boy, set for that purpose
Read aloud the names of the presents, appointed for the guests, to
Carry home with them. Wicked silver, what can it not? Then a gammon
Of bacon was set on the table, and above that several sharp sauces, a
Night-cap for himself, pudding-pies, and I know not what kind of
Birds: There was also brought in a rundlet of wine, boiled off a third
Part, and kept under ground to preserve its strength: There were also
Several other things I can give no account of; besides apples
Scallions, peaches, a whip, a knife, and what had been sent him; as
Sparrows, a flye-flap, raisons, Attick honey, night-gowns, judges
Robes, dry'd paste, table-books, with a pipe and a foot-stool: After
Which came in an hare and a sole-fish: And there was further sent him
A lamprey, a water-rat, with a frog at his tail, and a bundle of
Beets

Long time we smiled at these, and five hundred the like, that have now
Slipt my memory: But now when Ascyltos, who could not moderate
Hirnself, held up his hands and laught at every thing; nay so
Downright, that he was ready to cry: A free-man of Trimalchio's that
Sate next above me, grew hot upon't; and ""What,"" said he, ""thou sheep
What dost thou laugh at? does not this sumptuousness of my master
Please you? you're richer (forsooth) and eat better every day; so may
The guardian of this place favour me, as had I sate near him, I'd hit
Him a box on the ear ere this: A hopeful cullion, that mocks others;
Some pitiful night-walker, not worth the very urine he makes; and
Should I throw mine on him, knows not where to dry himself. I am not
(so help me Hercules) quickly angry, yet worms are bred even in tender
Flesh. He laughs! what has he to laugh at? what wooll did his father
Give for the bantling? Is he a Roman knight? I am the son of a king
How came I then, you'll say, to serve another? I did it of my self
And had rather be a citizen of Rome, than a tributary king, and now
Hope to live so, as to be no man's jeast. I walk like other men, with
An open face, and can shew my head among the best, for I owe no man a
Groat; I never had an action brought against me, or said to me on the
Exchange, Pay me what thou owest me. I bought some acres in the
Country, and have everything suitable to it: I feed twenty mouths
Besides dogs: I ransomed my bond-woman, lest another should wipe his
Hands on her smock; and between our selves, she cost me more than I'll
Tell ye at present. I was made a captain of horse gratis, and hope so
To die, that I shall have no occasion to blush in my grave: But art
Thou so prying into others, that thou never considerest thy self?
Canst thou spy a louse on another man's coat, and not see the tyck on
Thy own? Your master then is ancienter than your self, and 't please
Him; but yet thou, whose milk is not yet out of thy nose; that can'st
Not say boh to a goose; must you be making observations? Are you the
Wealthier man? If you are, dine twice, and sup twice; for my part, I
Value my credit more than treasures: Upon the whole matter, where's
The man that ever dunn'd me twice? Thou pipkin of a man, more limber
But nothing better than a strap of wet leather, I have served forty
Years in this house, came into it with my hair full grown; this palace
Was not then built, yet I made it my business to please my master, a
Person of honour, the parings of whose nails are more worth than thy
Whole body. I met several rubs in my way, but by the help of my good
Angel, I broke through them all: This is truth; it is as easie to make
A hunting-horn of a sow's tail, as to get into this company. What
Make ye in a dump now, like a goat at a heap of stones?""

On this Gito, who stood behind him, burst out a laughing; which the
Other taking notice of, fell upon the boy; and, ""Do you,"" said he
""laugh too, you curl-pated chattering magpye? O the Saturnals! Why
How now, sirrah! is it the month of December? When were you twenty, I
Pray? What would this collop dropt from the gibbet, this crows-meat
Be at? I'll find some or other way for Jupiter to plague thee, and
Him that bred thee no better, or never let me eat a good meals-meat
Again: I could, sirrah, but for the companies sake, I spare thee; tho'
Either we understand not aright, or they are sots themselves that
Carry no better a hand over thee; for without doubt it is true, like
Master like man. I am hot by nature, and can scarce contain my self;
Give me but a mess of peaseporridge, and I care not two-pence for my
Mother. Very well, I shall meet thee abroad, thou mouse; nay, rather
Mole-hill. May I never thrive more, but I'll drive that master of
Thine into a blade of rue; nor shalt thou (so help me Hercules) 'scape
Me, tho' thou couldst call in Jupiter to thy aid: I shall off with
Those locks, and take thee when that trifling master of thine shall be
Out of the way; thou wilt certainly fall into my hands, and either I
Know not my self, or I'll make thee leave that buffoonry: Tho' thy
Beard were of gold, I'll have thee bruised in a mortar, and him that
First taught thee: I never studied geometry, criticism, and meer words
Without sence, but I understand the fitting of stones for buildings;
Can run you over a hundred things, as to metal, weight, coin, and that
To a tittle; if you have a mind you and I will try it between us: I'll
Lay thee a wager, thou wizard, and tho' I am wholly ignorant of
Rhetorick, thou'lt presently see thou hast lost: Let no one run about
The bush to me; I come up to him: Resolve me, I say, 'which of us
Runs, yet stirs not out of his place: which of us grows bigger, and
Yet is less.' Do you scamper? Can't you tell what to make of it, that
You look so like a mouse in a trap? Therefore either hold thy tongue
Or don't provoke a better man than thy self, who does not think thee
Fram'd of nature, unless thou fansiest me taken with those yellow
Curl'd locks, which thou hast already vowed to some whore or other. O
Lucky opportunity! Come, let's walk the exchange, and see which of us
Can take up money: You'll be satisfied then, this iron has credit
Upon't; a pretty thing, is it not! a drunken fox. So may I gain while
I live, and die well; but the people will brain me if I follow not
That coat on thy back, which is not for thy wearing, where-ever thou
Goest: He's a precious tool too, whoever he were, that taught thee; a
Piece of green cheese, no master. I have learn'd as well as another
Man, and my master said it would be my own another day. Save your
Worship! get home as fast as you can, but look well about you, and
Have a care how you speak irreverently of your betters, or vie estates
With them; he that does it, his purse shall feel it: For my self, that
You see me as I am, I thank my stars for the art I have.""

Ascyltos was making answer to his railing; when Trimalchio, pleased
With that good grace of speaking, ""Go to,"" said he, ""no more of this
Wild talk, let us rather be pleasant: And you Hermeros, bear with the
Young-man, his blood boils; be thou the soberer man; he that is
Overcome in this matter, goes off conqueror: Even thy self, when thou
Wert such another capon, hadst nothing but coco, coco, and no heart at
All. Let us therefore, which is the better of the two, be heartily
Merry, and expect some admirers of Homer, that will be here
Presently.""

Nor were the words scarce out of his mouth, when in came a band of
Men, and made a rustling with their spears and targets. Trimalchio
Leaned on his pillow, the Homerists ratled out Greek verses, as
Arrogantly enough, they were won't to do, and he read a Latin book with
A loud voice: whereupon silence being made, ""Know ye,"" said he, ""what
Fable they were upon?

""Diomedes and Ganymede were two brothers, and Helen was their sister;
Agamemnon stole him away, and shamm'd Diana with a hind in his room
As says Homer in this place; and how the Trojans and the Parentines
Fought among themselves; but at last he got the better of it, and
Married his daughter Iphigenia to Achilles; on which Ajax run mad
And there's an end of the tale.""

On this the Homerists set up a shout, and a young boiled heifer with
An helmet on her head, was handed in upon a mighty charger: Ajax
Followed, and with a drawn sword, as if he were mad, made at it, now
In one place, then in another, still acting a Morris-dancer; till
Having cut it into joints, he took them upon the point of his sword
And distributed them. Nor had we much time to admire the conceit; for
Of a sudden the roof gave a crack, and the whole room shook: For my
Part, I got on my feet, but all in confusion, for fear some tumbler
Might drop on my head; the same also were the rest of the guests;
Still gaping and expecting what new thing should come from the clouds:
When straight the main beams opened, and a vast circle was let down
All round which hung golden garlands, and alabaster pots of sweet
Ointments

While we were required to take up these presents, I chanced to cast an
Eye upon the table, where there lay a fresh service of cheese-cakes
And tarts, and in the midst of them a lusty rundlet, stuck round with
All sorts of apples and grapes, as they commonly draw that figure

We greedily reached our hands towards it, when of a sudden, a new
Diversion gave us fresh mirth; for all the cheese-cakes, apples and
Tarts, upon the least touch, threw out a delicious liquid perfurne
Which fell upon us

We judging the mess to be sacred, that was so gorgeously set out
Stood up and began a health to the august founder, the father of his
Country: After which reverence, failing to catch that catch could, we
Filled our napkins and I chiefly, who thought nothing too good for my
Boy Gito

During this, in came three boys in white, their coats tuck'd about
Them; of whom, two set on the table three household gods with broaches
About their necks, and the other bearing round us a goblet of wine
Cry'd aloud, ""Be the gods favourable!"" ""The name of this,"" said he
""is cobler, that other's good-luck, and the third's spend-all:"" And as
The image of Trimalchio was carryed round, and every one kiss'd it, we
Thought it a shame not to do as the rest of the company

After this, when all of us had wished him health and happiness
Trimalchio, turning to Niceros, ""You were won't,"" said he, ""to be a
Good companion, but what's the matter we get not a word from ye now?
Let me entreat ye, as you would see me happy, do not break an old
Custom.""

Niceros, pleased with the frankness of his friend: ""Let me never
Thrive,"" said he, ""if I am not ready to caper out of my skin, to see
You in so good a humours; therefore what I say shall be all mirth;
Tho' I am afraid those grave fopps may laugh: but let them look to 't
I'll go on nevertheless; for what am I the worse for any one swearing?
I had rather they laugh at what I say, than at my self.""

Thus when he spake---- ----he began this tale:--

""While I was yet a servant we liv'd in a narrow lane, now the house of
Gavilla: There, as the gods would have it, I fell in love with
Tarentius's wife; he kept an eating-house. Ye all knew Melissa
Tarentina, a pretty little punching-block, and withal beautiful; but
(so help me Hercules) I minded her not so much for the matter of the
Point of that, as that she was good-humour'd; if I asked her any
Thing, she never deny'd me; and what money I had, I trusted her with
It; nor did she ever fail me when I'd occasion. It so happened, that
A she-companion of hers had dy'd in the country, and she was gone
Thither; how to come at her I could not tell; but a friend is seen at
A dead lift; it also happened my master was gone to Capua to dispatch
Somewhat or other: I laid hold of the opportunity, and persuaded mine
Host to take an evenings walk of four or five miles out of town, for
He was a stout fellow, and as bold as a devil: The moon shone as
Bright as day, and about cock-crowing we fell in with a burying-place
And certain monument of the dead: my man loitered behind me
A-star-gazing, and I sitting expecting him, fell a singing and
Numbering them; when looking round me, what should I see but mine host
Stript stark-naked, and his cloaths lying by the high-wayside. The
Sight struck me every where, and I stood as if I had been dead; but he
Piss'd round his cloaths, and of a sudden was turned to a wolf: Don't
Think I jest; I value no man's estate at that rate, as to tell a lye
But as I was saying, after he was turned to a wolf, he set up a howl
And fled to the woods. At first I knew not where I was, till going to
Take up his cloaths, I found them also turn'd to stone. Another man
Would have dy'd for fear, but I drew my sword, and slaying all the
Ghosts that came in my way, lighted at last on the place where my
Mistress was: I entered the first door; my eyes were sunk in my head
The sweat ran off me by more streams than one, and I was just
Breathing my last, without thought of recovery; when my Melissa coming
Up to me, began to wonder why I'd be walking so late; and 'if,' said
She, 'you had come a little sooner, you might have done us a kindness;
For a wolf came into the farm, and has made butchers work enough among
The cattle; but tho' he got off, he has no reason to laugh, for a
Servant of ours ran him through the neck with a pitchfork.' As soon as
I heard her, I could not hold open my eyes any longer, and ran home by
Daylight, like a vintner whose house had been robb'd: But coming by
The place where the cloaths were turned to stone, I saw nothing but a
Puddle of blood; and when I got home, found mine host lying a-bed like
An oxe in his stall, and a chirurgeon dressing his neck. I understood
Afterwards he was a fellow that could change his skin; but from that
Day forward, could never eat a bit of bread with him, no, if you'd
Have kill'd me. Let them that don't believe me, examine the truth of
It; may your good angels plague me as I tell ye a lye.""

The company were all wondring, when, ""Saving what you have said,""
Quoth Trimalchio, ""if there be faith in man, my hair stands on end
Because I know Niceros is no trifler; he's sure of what he says, and
Not given to talking: Nay, I'll tell ye as horrible a thing my self;
But see there, what's that behind the hangings?

""When I was yet a long-hair'd boy, for even then I liv'd a pleasant
Life, I had a minion, and he dy'd: He was (so help me Hercules) a
Pearl, a paragon, nay perfection it self: But when the poor mother
Lamented him, and we also were doing the same, some witches got round
The house on a sudden, you'd have taken them for hounds hunting a
Hare. We had then in the house a Cappadocian, a tall fellow, stout
And hardy, that would not have stept an inch out of his way for
Jupiter. He boldly drew his sword, and wrapping his coat about his
Left arm, leaped out of the house, and as it might be here, (no hurt
To the thing I touch) ran a woman clean through. We heard a pitiful
Groan, but not to lye, saw none of them. Our champion came in and
Threw himself on a bed, but all black and blue, so he had been trosh'd
With flails; for it seems some ill hand had touched him. We shut the
Door, and went on with our mourning; but the mother taking her son in
Her arms, and stroaking him, found nothing but a bolster of straw; it
Had neither heart, entrals, nor any thing, for the fairies belike had
Stollen him out of his cradle, and left that of straw instead of him
Give me credit, I beseech ye, women are craftier than we are, play
Their tricks by night, and turn every thing topsy-turvy. After this
Our tall fellow never came to his colour again, but in a few days died
Raving-mad.""

We all wondred, as not doubting what he said, and kissing the table in
Reverence to him, pray'd the privilege of the night, and that our
Places might be kept till we returned

And now we thought the lamps look'd double, and the whole room seem'd
Quite another thing, when Trimalchio again, ""I speak to you Plorimus
Won't you come in for a share? Will ye entertain us with nothing
Thou usedst to be a pleasant companion, couldst sing a song and tell a
Tale with the best; but alas! alas! the sweetmeats are gone."" ""My
Horses,"" said the other, ""ran away with my coach, I have been troubled
With the gout ever since. When I was a young fellow, I sung so long I
Had well nigh brought my self into a consumption. What do ye tell me
Of songs, tales, or barber shops? Who ever came near me but one, only
Apelles;"" and with setting his hand to his mouth, whistled out
Somewhat, I know not what, which afterwards he swore was Greek
Trimalchio also when he mimicked the trumpets, looked on his minion
And called him CrÅ“sus: Yet the boy was blear-eye'd, and swathing up
A little black bitch with nasty teeth, and over-grown with fat, in
Green swadlingclouts, he set half a loaf on the table, which she
Refusing, he cram'd her with it: on which Trimalchio commanded the
Guardian of his house and family, Scylax, to be brought; when
Presently was led in a beautiful mastiff in a chain, who having a hint
Given him by a knock of the porter's foot, lay down before the table:
Whereupon Trimalchio throwing him a manchet; ""There's no one,"" said
He, ""in this house of mine, loves me better than this dog."" The boy
Taking it in dudgeon that Scylax should be so commended, laid the
Bitch on the floor, and challenged the dog to have a rubber with him
On this Scylax, after the manner of dogs, set up such a hideous
Barking, that it fill'd the room; and snapping at him, almost rent off
A brooch that hung on CrÅ“sus's breast; nor did the scuffle end
Here, for the great candle being overturn'd on the table, broke all
The chrystal glasses, and threw the scalding oil on the guests

Trimalchio, not to seem concerned at the loss, kissed the boy, and
Commanded him to get on his back; nor was it long e're he was a
Cock-horse, and slapping his masters shoulders, and laughing, cry'd
Out, ""Fool, fool, and how many of them have we here?""

Trimalchio thus kept under for a while, commanded a bumper to be
Fill'd and given round to the waiters, with this further, that
Whosoever refused it should have it poured down his collar. Thus one
While we were grave, and other while merry

After this came junkets and made dishes, the very remembrance of
Which, if I may be believed, will not yet down with me; for there were
Several cram'd hens given about under the notion of thrushes, and
Goose eggs with caps upon them; which Trimalchio, nor without
Ostentation press'd us to eat; adding withal, that their bones were
Taken out

Nor were the words scarce out of his mouth, when a beadle rapp'd at
The door, and one in white, with a company of roisters following him
Came in upon us: For my part I was not a little surprized; and by his
Lordliness taking him for the Mayor of a town, and our selves within
His liberties, was getting upon my feet. Agamemnon laught to see me
So concerned, and bade me sit still; ""for,"" said he, ""this Habinas is
A captain of horse, a good mason, and has a special faculty in making
Monuments.""

Recovered again with his words, I kept my seat, and wholly fix'd my
Eye on Habinas: He came in drunk, and lolling on his wife's shoulders
With some garlands about him, his face all trickling down with
Ointment, he seated himself at the head of the table, and
Incontinently called for wine and hot water

Trimalchio was pleased with the humour, and calling for a bigger
Glass, asked him what entertainment he had whence he came?

""Every thing,"" said the other, ""but thy self; for my inclination was
Here; tho' (so help me Hercules) it was all well. Scissa kept a
Nine-days feast for his servant Miscellus, whom he infranchised after
He was dead: It is said he had a round sum in the chequer, for they
Reckon he died worth 50,000 sesterces; yet this was all done in good
Order; tho' every one of us were obliged to pour half his drink on the
Grave.""

""But,"" said Trimalchio, ""what had ye to eat?"" ""I'll tell ye,"" quoth
Habinas, ""as near as I can, for my memory is not so good, but that
Sometimes I forget my own name: However, for the first dish we had a
Goodly porker, with a garland upon him, and puddings, goose giblets
Lamb-stones, sweetbreads, and gizzards round him; there were also
Beets and houshold-bread of his own baking, for himself, which I would
Rather have than white; it makes a man strong, and I never complain of
What I like. The next was a cold tart, with excellent warm honey, and
That Spanish, running upon it. I eat little of the tart, but more of
The honey; I tasted also the red pulse, and lupines, by the advice of
Calvus, and several apples, of which I took away two in my
Handkerchief: for if I bring home nothing to my little she slave, I
Shall have snubs enough: this dame of mine puts me often in mind of
Her. We had also on a side-table the haunch of a bear, which
Scintilla tasting ere she was aware, had like to have thrown up her
Guts: I on the other hand eat a pound of it or better, for methought
It tasted like boars flesh; and said I, if a bear eats a man, why may
Not a man much more eat a bear? To be short, we had cream cheese
Wine boil'd off to a third part, fry'd snails, chitterlings, livers
Eggs, turneps, mustard, and a bowl that held a gallon. Don't disturb
Me, Palamedes; there were also handled about a basket of sugar-cakes
Of which we wantonly took some, and sent away the gammon of bacon
But tell me Caius, I beseech you, what's the matter that Fortunata
Sits not among us?"" ""How came you to know her?"" quoth Trimalchio;
""for till she has gotten her plate together, and distributed what we
Leave among the servants, not a sip of any thing goes into her mouth.""

""But unless she sits down,"" replied Habinas, ""I'll be gone""; and was
Getting up, but that the word being four times given about for her
She came at last in a greenish gown and a cherry-colour'd stomacher
Beneath which might be seen her petticoat and embroidered garters;
Then wiping her hands on her neckcloth, she sate on that bed whereon
Scintilla the wife of Habinas was; and having given her a kiss, told
Her it was in compliment to her that she was there. At length it came
To this, that she took off her weighty bracelets, and shewed them to
Scintilla, which she admiring, she also unbuckled her garters and a
Net-work purse, which she said was of the finest gold

Trimalchio observed it, and commanding all to be laid before him
""See,"" said he, ""this womans finery, and what fools our wives make us;
They should be six pound and a half; yet I've another of Mercury's
Making, that weighs ten"": And that he might not be thought to tell a
Lye, called for his gold scales, and commanded them to be weighed: Nor
Had Scintilla more wit than t'other, for pulling a golden box out of
Her bosom, which she called good luck, she took out of it two large
Pearl pendants, giving them in like manner to Fortunata to view:
""See,"" quoth she, ""what 'tis to have a kind husband, I am sure no
Woman has better."" ""What,"" said Habinas, ""hast thou put the sham on
Me? thou toldst me thou couldst be contented with glass beads; and for
This trick, if I had a daughter I'd cut off her ears; tho' were there
No women what were the rest worth? This is to piss warm and drink
Cold.""

Mean time the women perceiving they were toucht, twitter'd among
Themselves, and being got drunk, fell to kissing one another; one
Commended the mistress of the house, t'other the master: when during
This chatter, Habinas stealing behind Fortunata, gave her such a toss
On the bed, that her heels flew as high as her head, on which she gave
A squeak or two, and finding her thighs bare, ran her head under
Scintilla's smock

This held a while, till Trimalchio calling for a second service to
Entertain his new guests, the servants took away the tables that were
Before us, and having brought others, strew'd the room with pin-dust
Mixt with vermillion and saffron; and what I never saw before, the
Dust of a looking-glass ground to powder

When immediately, quoth Trimalchio, ""I could have been contented with
Those first dishes; but since we have got other tables, we must also
Have another service; and if there be any thing worth our having
Bring it.""

On which, a spruce boy that served us with warm water, began to
Imitate a nightingale; till Trimalchio giving the word, a servant that
Waited on Habinas, set up another humour, and, as I believe, commanded
By his master, nois'd out;

""Mean time Ã†neas had put off to sea.""

Nor was there ever a harsher sound yet pierced my ears; for besides
His disordered country tone, his pitiful and starvling way of
Delivery, he so stufft it with scraps of verses, that even Virgil then
First disrelished me; till at last so tyr'd, that he could hold no
Longer; ""D'ye think,"" said Habinas, ""this boy has learn'd nothing? I
Bred him with juglers that follow the fair: Nor has he his fellow
Whether he humours a muliteer or a jester. This never-be-good has
Abundance of wit; he's a taylor, a cook, a baker, a jack of all
Trades, and but for two faults, were exact to a hair: He's
Crack-brain'd, and snores in his sleep: For that cast of his eye I
Value it not, he looks like Venus, and therefore his tongue is ever
Running; and were that eye out he were worth the money I gave for
Him.""

On which Scintilla interrupting him, told him he was a naughty man
For not telling all his servant's good qualities: ""He's a pimp,"" said
He, ""if not worse, but I'll take care he be branded for that.""

Trimalchio laught, and said he knew he was a Cappadocian that never
Beguiled himself of any thing, and ""(so help me Hercules) I commend
Him for 't: when will you find such another, but Scintilla, you must
Not be jealous! Believe me, and I know you too; may I so enjoy the
Health you wish me, as I play'd at leap-frog so long with our boy
That my master grew jealous, and sent me to dig in the country: But
Hold thy tongue and I'll give thee a loaf."" I marvel,"" said I
""whether they be all mash'd together or made of loam; for in a
Saturnal at Rome, my self saw the like imaginary shew of a supper.""

Nor had I scarce said it, when--quoth Trimalchio, ""Let me so grow in
Estate, not bulk, as my cook made all of this out of one hog; there is
Not an excellenter fellow than himself; he shall, if he please, make
Ye a poll of ling of a sows tripe; a wood-culver of fat bacon; a
Turtle of a spring of pork; and a hen of a collar of brawn; and
Therefore of my own fancy, I gave him a name proper to him, for he is
Called DÃ¦dalus: And because he understands his business, I had
Chopping-knives of the best steel brought him from Rome""; and with
That, calling for them, he turn'd them over, and admiring them
Offered us the liberty of trying their edge on his cheek

On this came in two servants as quarrelling about their collars, at
Which each of them had a large earthen pot hanging; and when
Trimalchio determined the matter between them, neither of them stood
To his sentence, but fell to club-law, and broke each others pots

This drunken presumption put us out of order; yet casting an eye on
The combatants, we saw oisters and scallops running from the pots, and
Another boy receiving them in a charger, which he carried round the
Guests

Nor was the cook's ingenuity short of the rest, for he brought us a
Dish of grill'd snails on a silver gridiron, and with a shrill
Unpleasant voice, sang as he went. I am asham'd of what follow'd;
For, what was never heard of till then, the boys came in with a bason
Of liquid perfumes, and first binding our legs, ancles and feet, with
Garlands, anointed them with it, and put the rest into the wine vessel
And the lamps

And now Fortunata began to dance, and Scintilla's hands went faster
Than her tongue; when, quoth Trimalchio, ""Sit down Philargyrus; I give
Ye leave, and you Carrio, because you are a green-ribbon-man, and you
Minophilus bid your comrade do the like""; what shall I say more? The
Family so crowded upon us, that we were almost thrust off our beds;
And who should be seated above me, but the cook who had made a goose
Of a hog, all stinking of pickle and kitchen-stuff; nor yet content
That he sate amongst us, he fell immediately to personate Thespis the
Tragedian, and dare his master to a wager which of them two should win
The prize next wrestling

Trimalchio abash'd at the challenge; ""My friends,"" said he, ""even
Servants are men; and however oppress'd by ill luck, sucked the same
Milk our selves did; and for mine, it shall not be long e're I make
Them free without prejudice to my self: to be short, I enfranchise all
Of them by my last will and testament

""I give Philargus a country farm, and his she-comrade; to Carrio an
Island, with a twentieth part of my moveables, a bed and its
Furniture; for I make Fortunata my heiress, whom I recommend to all my
Friends, and publish what I have done, to the end my family may so
Love me now, as if I were dead.""

All thanked their master for his kindness; and he, as having forgotten
Trifles, called for a copy of his will, which he read from one end to
The other, the family all the while sighing and sobbing; afterwards
Turning to Habinas, ""Tell me, my best of friends,"" said he, ""do you go
On with my monument as I directed ye, I earnestly entreat ye, that at
The feet of my statue you carve me my little bitch, as also garlands
And ointments, and all the battles I have been in, that by your
Kindness I may live when I am dead: Be sure too that it have an
Hundred feet as it fronts the highway, and as it looks towards the
Fields two hundred: I will also, that there be all sorts of fruit and
Vines round my ashes, and that in great abundance: For it is a gross
Mistake to furnish houses for the living, and take no care of those we
Are to abide in for ever: And therefore in the first place, I will
Have it engraven--

'LET NO HEIR OF MINE PRETEND TO THIS MONUMENT.'

""And that I may receive no injury after I am dead, I'll have a codicil
Annext to my will, whereby I'll appoint one of my freed-men the keeper
Of this monument, that the people make not a house-of-office of it
Make me also, I beseech you, on this my monument, ships under full
Sail, and my self in my robes sitting on the bench, with five gold
Rings on my fingers, and scattering moneys among the common people;
For you know I have ordered ye a funeral feast, and two-pence a-piece
In money. You shall also, if you think fit, shape me some of these
Beds we now sit on, and all the people making their court to me. On
My right hand place my Fortunata's statue, with a dove in one hand
And leading a little dog in her girdle with the other: As also my
Cicero, and large wine vessels close cork'd that the wine don't run
Out, and yet carve one of them as broken, and a boy weeping over it;
As also a sun-dial in the middle, that whoever comes to see
What's-a-clock, may read my name whether he will or no. And lastly
Have a special consideration whether you think this epitaph sufficient
Enough:

'HERE RESTS CAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO, PATRON OF THE LEARNED. A TROOP
OF HORSE WAS DECREED HIM, WITHOUT SUING FOR, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN A
SENATOR WOULD HE HAVE ACCEPTED IT. A PIOUS MAN, HONEST, VALIANT, AND
TRUE TO HIS FRIEND. HE RAISED HIMSELF FROM LITTLE OR NOTHING, BUT
LEFT BEHIND HIM A PRODIGIOUS ESTATE, YET NEVER HEARD A PHILOSOPHER
FAREWELL TO YOU ALSO.'""

This said, Trimalchio wept plentifully, Fortunata wept, Habinas wept
And the whole family set up a cry as it had been his funeral; nay, I
Also whin'd for company: when, quoth Trimalchio, ""Since you know we
Must die, why don't we live while we may? so let me live my self to
See you happy; as, if we plunge our selves in the bath we shall not
Repent it: At my peril be it; I'll lead the way, for this room is
Grown as hot as an oven."" ""Say you so,"" quoth Habinas, ""nor am I
Afraid to make two days of one""; and therewith got up barefoot and
Follow'd Trimalchio

I on the other hand turning to Ascyltos, asked him what he thought of
It, for ""if I but see the bath I shall swoon away.""

""Let's lagg behind then,"" said he, ""and whilst they are getting in
We'll slip off in the crowd.""

The contrivance pleased us; and so Gito leading the way through the
Portico, we came to the last gate, where a chained dog bolted upon us
So furiously, that Ascyltos fell into the fishpond. I, who had been
Frighted at the painted dog, and now gotten as drunk as Ascyltos
While I endeavoured to get hold of him, fell in my self; at last the
Porter's coming in saved us, for he quieted the dog and drew us out;
But Gito, like a sharp rascal, delivered himself, for whatever had
Been given him at supper to carry home with him, he threw it the dog
And that mollified him

But, when shivering with cold, we desired the porter to let us out:
""You're mistaken,"" said he, ""if ye think to go out the same way ye
Came in, for no guest ere yet did; they came in at one gate and are
Let out by another.""

In this sad pickle, what should we do? we found ourselves in a new
Kind of labyrinth, and for bathing, we'd enough of it already:
However, necessity enforcing us, we pray'd him to show us the way to
The bath: and Gito having hung out our cloaths a drying in the porch
We entred the bath, which was somewhat narrow, and sunk in the earth
Not unlike a rainwater cistern; in this stood Trimalchio stark-naked:
Nor could we avoid his filthy tricks; for he said, nothing was better
Than to bathe in a crowd; and that every place had in times past been
A grinding-house. Being weary at length, he sate down, and provok'd
By the noisiness of the bath, set up his drunken throat, and fell a
Murdering some songs of Menecrates, as they that understood him told
Us

Other guests ran round the cistern with their arms across, and made a
Clamorous slap with their mouths; others either try'd to take up a
Ring from the pavement, with their hands bound behind them, or putting
One knee to the ground, to kiss their great toes backward

While they thus entertained one another, we went into the hot-house
That had been heated for Trimalchio; and being now recovered of our
Drunkenness, were brought into another room, where Fortunata had set
Out a fresh entertainment. Above the lamps I observed some women's
Gewgaws. The tables were massy silver, the earthen ware double gilt
And a conduit running with wine; when, quoth Trimalchio, ""This day, my
Friends, a servant of mine opened a barber's shop; he's well to pass
A thrifty fellow, and a favourite of mine: Come, let the floor have a
Drink as well as our selves; and for our part, we'll sit to it till
Day-light.""

While he was yet speaking, a cock crow'd, at which Trimalchio grew
Disordered, and commanded the wine to be thrown under table, and
Sprinkle the larnps with it; then changing a ring to his right hand
""it is not for nothing,"" said he, ""this trumpeter has given us notice;
For either the house should be on fire, or one of the neighbourhood
Will kill himself: Far from us be it, and therefore, whoever brings me
This discoverer I'll give him a reward.""

When immediately a cock was brought in, and Trimalchio, commanding to
Have him drest he was torn in pieces by that exquisite cook, who a
Little before had make us fish and fowl of a hog, and put in a
Stew-pan, and while DÃ¦dalus was taking a lusty draught, Fortunata
Ground pepper

After which Trimalchio taking some of the banquet, bid the waiters go
To supper, and let others supply their places

Whereupon came in another rank of servants, and as the former going
Cry'd out, ""Farewell, Caius,"" those coming in cry'd out, ""Sit thou
Merry, Caius.""

And here our mirth first began to be disturb'd; for a beautiful boy
Coming in among those new servants, Trimalchio plucked the boy to him
And did nothing but kiss him over and over: Whereupon Fortunata to
Maintain her right, began to rail at Trimalchio, called him pitiful
Fellow, one that could not bridle his lust, shame and dishonour to an
Honest woman, and a very dog. Trimalchio on the other hand, all
Confounded and vex'd at her taunts, threw a goblet at her head: She
Fell a roaring as if she had lost an eye, and clapt both her hands
Before it

Scintilla also stood amazed, and covered Fortunata all trembling as
She was, in her bosom; the boy also put a cold pitcher to her cheek
On which she leaned and made a lamentable wailing and blubbing

But Trimalchio quite contrary; ""for,"" said he, ""what am I the better
For this graceless buttock? 'Tis well known I took her out of a
Bawdy-house, and made her an honest woman, but now blown up like a
Frog she bespatters herself; a very block, no woman: But this poor boy
Born in a hovel, never dreams of palaces. May my good genius so
Befriend me, as I'll bring down this seeming saint, but in her actions
A whore rampant: As inconsiderable as she makes me, I might have had a
Wife with two hundred and fifty pistols; you know I don't lye; but she
Was somewhat in years, and Agatho the sweet oilman, persuaded me not
To let my name run out, when instead of doing good to her, I have put
A thorn in my own foot: but I'll have a care that she dig me not out
Of my grave with her nails: And that she may know what I'll do at
Present, I will not, Habinas, have you put her statue in my monument
That I have no words with her when I am dead: Nay, that she may know I
Am able to plague her, she shall not so much as kiss me when I die.""
After this ratling, Habinas entreated him to give over his anger;
""There's none of us all,"" said he, ""but some time or other does amiss;
We are but men, not gods."" Weeping Scintilla said the same, called
Him Caius, and by his own good nature, besought him to be pacified

Trimalchio not able to hold tears any longer, ""I beg of you, Habinas,""
Said he, ""and as you wish to enjoy what you have gotten, if I have
Done any thing without cause, spit in my face: I kiss'd the boy 'tis
True, not for his beauty, but that he's a hopeful thrifty lad: He has
Several sentences by heart, can read a book at first sight; saves
Money out of his days provision; has a binn of his own to keep it, and
Two drinking cups; and does he not deserve to be in my eye? but
Fortunata, forsooth, will not have it so; your bandy legs won't away
With it. Be content with your own, thou she-kite, and don't disquiet
Me, thou harlotry, or otherwise thou'lt find what I am; thou knowest
Well enough, if I once set on't, 'tis immoveable. But we'll remember
The living

""Come, my friends, let's see how merry ye can be, for in my time I
Have been no better than your selves, but by my own industry I am what
I am: 'Tis the heart makes a man, all the rest is but stuff. I buy
Cheap and sell dear; another man may sell ye other things, but I enjoy
My self; and thou dunghillraker, are thou yet gruntling, I'll make ye
Hereafter do it for somewhat

""But as I was saying my frugality brought the fortune I have: I came
Out of Asia no taller than this candlestick, and daily measured my
Self by it: and that I might get a beard the sooner, rubb'd my lips
With the candle-grease; yet I kept Ganymede to my master fourteen
Years (nor is any thing dishonourable that the master commands) and
The same time contented my mistress: Ye know what I mean, I'll say no
More, for I am no boaster. By this means, as the gods would have it
The governing the house was committed to me, and nothing was done but
By my guidance: What need many words? He made me joint-heir with
CÃ¦sar, and I had by it a Senator's estate; but no man thinks he has
Enough, and I had a mighty desire to turn merchant. Not to detain you
Longer; I built five ships, freighted them with wines, which at that
Time were as dear as gold, and sent them to Rome; you'll think I
Desir'd to have it so: All my ships founder'd at sea; 'tis a great
Truth, no story; Neptune swallowed me in one day three hundred
Thousand sesterties. Do ye think I broke upon 't, (so help me
Hercules) no; the loss was but a flea-bite: For, as if there had been
No such thing, I built others, larger, better, and more fortunate than
The former; so that every one called me a man of courage. As you know
A great ship carries a great deal of force, I loaded them again with
Wine, bacon, beans, unguents, planes: And here Fortunata shewed her
Affection; for she sold what she had; nay, her very cloaths, and put a
Round sum in my pocket; tho' yet it was but a pig of my own sow. What
The gods will is quickly done; I got an hundred thousand sesterties by
The voyage, and forthwith redeemed the lands my patron had left me
Built me a house, bought cattle to sell them again, and whatever I
Went about gathered like a snow-ball: But when I grew richer than all
The country besides, I took up; and from a merchant turn'd usurer, and
Bought servants

""Thus resolved to give over trading, a certain astrologer that chanc'd
To light on this village, would have persuaded me to the contrary. He
Was a GrÃ¦cian, his name SÅ“rapa, one that held correspondence
With the gods. He told me a deal that I had forgotten, and laid
Everything before me from top to bottom: He knew all I had within me
And told me what I had the night before to supper; you'd have thought
He had liv'd with me all his life

""I beseech you, Habinas, for I think you was there; he told me the
Intrigue between my mistress and me; that I had but ill luck at
Friends; that no one ever made me a return of my kindnesses: That I
Had large possessions, but nourished a viper in my bosom: Why should I
Not tell you all? I have by his account, thirty years, four months
And two days yet to live; and in a short time shall have another
Estate left me

""Thus my fortune-teller. But if I can join my lands here to those in
Apulia, I shall do well enough: in the mean, and while Mercury is my
Guardian, I have built this house: it was once you know, a pitiful
Cabin, but now as magnificent as a temple: it has four dining rooms
Twenty bed-chambers two marble porticoes, a gallery above stairs, my
Own apartment, another for this viper; a very good porter's lodge, and
The house capable of receiving a thousand guests: To be short, when
Ever Scaurus comes this way, he had rather lodge here than at his own
House, tho' it lie to the seaward: and many other conveniences it has
Which I'll shew you by and by. Believe me, he that has a penny in his
Purse, is worth a penny: Have and you shall be esteemed. And so your
Friend, once no better than a frog, is now a king

""And now Stichus bring me the furniture in which I design to be
Carried to my funeral pile; bring also the unguent, and some of that
Pot, which I ordered for the cleansing my bones.""

Stichus lingered not, but brought in a white coverlet, and robe of
State, and pray'd us to try if they were not fine wooll, and well
Woven. ""And see you Stichus,"" said Trimalchio smiling, ""that neither
Mice nor moths come at them, for if they do I'll burn you alive. I
Will be brought out in pomp, that all the people may speak well of
Me.""

With that opening a glass bottle of spicknard, he caused us all to be
Anointed; and ""I hope,"" said he, ""it will do as much good when I am
Dead, as it does while I am living"": Then commanding the wine vessels
To be filled again; ""Fausie,"" said he, ""you are invited to my funeral
Feast."" We by this time nauseated, were ready to vomit; Trimalchio
Also was gotten confoundedly drunk, when behold, a new interlude; he
Called for the coronets to come in; and, underset with pillows, and
Stretching himself at length on the bed, ""suppose me,"" said he, ""now
Dead, say somewhat, I beseech you, in praise of me.""

Whereupon the coronets sounded as it had been at a funeral; but one
Above the rest, a servant of that freed-man of Trimalchio's, that was
Best condition'd of 'em all, made such a thundring, that it rais'd the
Neighbourhood: On which the watch thinking the house was on fire
Broke open the gate, and making an uproar after their manner, ran in
With water and hatchets: When finding so fair an opportunity, we gave
Agamemnon the slip, and scamper'd off, as if it had been a real fire"

Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me

Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given

I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true

Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury

Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)

It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)

If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword

And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"

I'd give you my heart if you needed it""

""You're a professional""

Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over

In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure

And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward

And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to

Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

Swirled you into all of my poems

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox

Am I bad or mad or wise?

What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

Spread my wings like a parachute

I swept in at the rescue
The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger

Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

[Verse 2]
You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it

And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon

Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
It just didn't happen

Say you loved me

Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck

And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"

You're thinkin' that I hate you now

We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't

Would surprise the whole school

See the vultures circlin', dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out

My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle. When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mysеlf.

How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.

You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.

It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.

Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.

But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.

There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of naïveté, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.

I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in ""Blank Space"" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in ""Welcome To New York."" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.

I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.

This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.

I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.

It's been waiting for you.

We’re a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop

Halfway out the door, but it won't close

Just to leave me in the night?

You went to a party

Did you get anxious though
On the way home?

You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk"

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[Verse 2]
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

9673210,1989 (Taylors Version) [Prologue],754738,1989 (Taylor’s Version),/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/1989_Taylor_sVersion_,"PrologueWhen I was 24 I sat in a backstage dressing room in London, buzzing with anticipation. My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle. When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mysеlf.

How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.

You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.

It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.

Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.

But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.

There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of naïveté, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.

I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in ""Blank Space"" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in ""Welcome To New York."" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.

I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.

This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.

I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.

It's been waiting for you.

And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And life was never worse, but never better

One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in lovе

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

9673210,1989 (Taylors Version) [Prologue],1082316,1989 (Taylor’s Version) (Tangerine Edition),/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums/data/Albums/1989_Taylor_sVersion__TangerineEdition_,"PrologueWhen I was 24 I sat in a backstage dressing room in London, buzzing with anticipation. My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle. When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mysеlf.

How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.

You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.

It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.

Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.

But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.

There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of naïveté, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.

I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in ""Blank Space"" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in ""Welcome To New York."" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.

I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.

This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.

I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.

It's been waiting for you.

Alright, Los Angeles, we have arrived
At the very first bridge of the evening
Now, I have a question
Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge?
Prove it

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded

As everything was slipping right out of our hands

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause it's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone"" (Oh)

’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
Like it’s killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
When it all broke down
And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how

Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight

[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw

The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashеd through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

That you'll stand by me forever

When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

[Bridge]
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

[Verse 3]
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down

And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
[Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""

[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""

[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors

And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said

Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I still remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

'Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, or if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
It's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
You know that I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man

Yeah, I'd be the man, yeah
Oh, I'd be the man

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
